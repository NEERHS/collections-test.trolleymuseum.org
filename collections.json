Various sources give construction dates between 1873 and 1886 while the Seashore roster has settled on 1878 as the build date. Union Street Railway electrified No. 34 about 1894. Union Street Ry. extensively rebuilt No. 34 to a railway post office car about 1906. In 1906, No. 34 began operating as an RPO between Fall River and Onset. As a railway post office car, two postal clerks on board the car sorted and cancelled mail while picking up and dropping off mail at points along the way. This RPO route ran over the Union Street Ry. from Fall River through New Bedford and Fairhaven and then farther east over the affiliated New Bedford & Onset Street Ry. to the Onset section of Wareham, MA. Mail cancelled on the car received a \"WARE & FALL RIVER RPO\" postmark. After mail service ended in 1927, No. 34 went into storage and was used occasionally as a work car. The great New England hurricane of 1938 flooded the carbarn where No. 34 was stored and damaged the car's motors. No. 34 did not run after the hurricane.\n\nSeashore acquired No. 34 in 1947. Seashore briefly stored the car at the Edaville Railroad in South Carver, MA before bringing it to Maine. In 1980, Seashore restored one motor on No. 34. No. 34, along with Portsmouth Dover & York No. 108, ran as an active railway post office on October 8, 1983 for the streetcar postage stamp first day of issue ceremony officiated by then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and Postmaster General William Bolger. Union Street Ry. No. 302, another RPO car, is preserved at the Shore Line Trolley Museum in East Haven, CT. Based on the 1878 construction date, No. 34 is the oldest rail car in the Seashore collection, although only some components are from the original construction. At Seashore, only the horse-drawn Suffolk County Sheriff's wagon and sleigh are older. At the museum, No. 34 joins Union Street Ry.

Its Roxbury Crossing shop, though very small, turned out new horse cars on a weekly basis, and had enough excess capacity to build cars for the neighboring Cambridge RR. One of these products was the Met's car 804, which was outshopped in 1884 or 1885. The Metropolitan was absorbed by the West End Street Ry. in 1887, along with three other local properties, making the West End the world's largest horse railway. Metropolitan 804 became West End No. 724. The West End Street Railway began converting from horse car to electric operation in 1889. No. 724 was electrified and rebuilt from a 16 foot body to a 20 foot body in 1893, without being again renumbered. No. 724 was one of 131 former horse cars that the West End electrified and lengthened; these became known as \"spliced cars.\" No. 724 was painted vermillion with white trim and assigned to the South Boston Division. \n\nNo. 724 operated in passenger service until 1912, when it was converted into a wrecker. In 1935, it was repurposed as a rail grinding car, carrying grinding blocks between the wheels of its truck. No. 724 survived corporate reorganizations as the Boston Elevated Railway in 1897, the Metropolitan Transit Authority in 1947 and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 1964. By 1967, No. 724 was believed to be the oldest trolley car owned by a public transit system in North America. Into the 1950s, No. 724 was used on the streets to grind track irregularities. Its final years were spent at Charlestown Yard where new but rusted rails would be set up, and No. 724 would run over the rails to grind off heavy rust accumulations.\n\n\nNo. 724 was still in maintenance service in 1967, when the museum approached the MBTA about its preservation. The result was not only 724's preservation, but a long term agreement where the MBTA would provide cars and other vehicles for preservation for a nominal fee. In return, the museum would provide cars to the MBTA for historic and other purposes as required. This agreement provided for the MBTA to lease #724 to the museum for $1 per year. In 1975, the MBTA transferred ownership of the car to the museum. No. 724 has been partially restored, and careful removal of many layers of paint has exposed the lettering \"South Boston\" dating to its lengthening in 1893.

It became the Union Street Railway in 1887. The company began converting to electric streetcars in 1890.\n\nSixteen foot closed horsecars were the state-of-the-art in the mid-1880s and were used on about every system in the country. There were two major varieties, single ended \"bobtails\" operated on circular routes, or double-ended cars used on point-to-point routes. The bobtails also could be operated with only a driver, while the double ended cars required a conductor to guard the rear doors and collect fares. The latter type was more common, as they loaded and unloaded more quickly and were more adaptable to variations in operation. No. 10 is a typical example of a double-ended car, built in 1880 or 1885 (sources differ). It was normally pulled by a single horse at 6 to 8 miles per hour. The car operated a short shuttle route on North Main Street in Fairhaven, MA (originally, Oxford, for which the car is lettered). The Union Street Railway used this car well into the 1890s, and then retired it to serve as a tool shed. In 1914, the company decided to renovate and repaint No. 10 for special events. The railway brought out No. 10 to run on July 4, 1914. Union Street Railway stored No. 10 under a tarp at its Weld Street carhouse. No. 10 often made appearances on the street on special occasions, such as in 1922 when New Bedford celebrated its 50th anniversary of street railway service. \n\nVery few sixteen-foot cars remained by the 1910s, and even fewer have survived into the 21st century. Car 10 is a classic example of these once-ubiquitous cars. No. 10's paint scheme features fancy scroll work on the sides of the car. \n\nUnion Street Railway donated No. 10 to Seashore in 1954. At the time, Seashore did not have indoor space for No. 10. So, Seashore initially loaned No. 10 to the Larz Anderson Museum in Brookline, MA before bringing it to Kennebunkport in 1955. No. 10 was also exhibited at the Antique Auto Museum in Princeton, MA. In 1958, the Metropolitan Transit Authority borrowed No. 10. The MTA mounted it on rubber tires and pulled it through Boston streets with a horse and a mule for an advertising campaign. Seashore occasionally hired a horse to pull No. 10 for visitors. After loaning No. 10 to Newburyport, NH for a parade in 1977, Seashore decided to stop sending the car out of the museum. No. 10 has not been repainted or refinished since being retired.

That year, the Fitchburg Street Railway purchased No. 8 from J.G. Brill. In 1892, the Fitchburg Street Ry. acquired the Leominster Street Railway, forming the Fitchburg & Leominster Street Railway. The company also began converting to electric street cars in 1892. The company purchased Whalom Park and began running to that amusement park in 1893. (Whalom Park remained in operation until 2000.) At some point, No. 8 was acquired by the Templeton Street Railway and renumbered #12. The Templeton Street Railway, which commenced operation in 1901, served Gardner and Templeton, MA. In 1913, the Templeton Street Railway became part of the Northern Massachusetts Street Railway which ran from Fitchburg to Gardner, MA. A picture in the May 1942 issue of Railroad Magazine shows that, at some point, this car was converted to electric operation. No. 12's retirement date is not known, but No. 12 may have been stored for a period by the Northern Massachusetts. About 1923, No. 12 was acquired by a private owner and placed, without trucks, in a field as a grape arbor. \n\nAbout 1954, C. David Perry purchased No. 12 and some other former Templeton Street Railway carbodies. Perry cut No. 12 in half to move it about a mile to his property. Perry undertook a restoration of the car, keeping most of the metal components but replacing most of the wood. Perry apparently removed the trolley boards from the roof and a trolley pole (if it was present in the 1950s). Perry later became a member of Seashore, and, in 1957, donated No. 12 to the museum. No. 12 is Seashore's only example of a seven bench open car and Seashore's only open horsecar of any kind. No. 12 is Seashore's third oldest car. Although it was acquired in poor condition, significant work has been accomplished on the car, arresting the deterioration, and restoring several structural components. At Seashore, No. 12 has spent much of its time in Shop No. 1.

The company expanded to other towns and became the Boston and Northern Street Railway in 1901. The B&N merged with the Old Colony Street Railway in 1911 to form the Bay State Street Railway. With multiple divisions operating north and south of Boston, the Bay State Street Ry. served three states entering New Hampshire at Nashua and penetrating Rhode Island as far as Newport. The company was reorganized as the Eastern Massachusetts Street Ry. in 1919. The history of No. 3256 is largely unknown. O.R. Cummings found Bay State Street Ry. roster information showing that J.G. Brill built 8 bench open car No. 3255 in 1887 and that the Lynn & Boston's own shops built 8 bench open car No. 3257 also in 1887. So, the builder of No. 3256 may have been either J.G. Brill or the Lynn & Boston's own shops, probably about 1887. Both No. 3255 and No. 3257 were originally horsecars, later converted to electric. So, this is probably the case with No. 3256. This car apparently carried No. 3256 when it was retired, but it likely had a different number when it first operated on the Lynn & Boston. The car's retirement date is uncertain, but it was probably retired before the creation of the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway.\n\nSometime before 1930, the body of No. 3256 was placed near a pond in Lynn, MA, and a summer camp building was built around the car. The car served as the living room. The building later became the Fred Mungan's family house. In 1995, the Mungans dismantled the portion of the house containing the streetcar, and Fred Mungan donated the body of the 8 bench open car to Seashore. The body was in fairly good condition with the lettering \"3256\" intact. The car body is missing its single truck and its electrical and mechanical components.

A few museum vehicles, however, provided unusually luxurious travel for transit executives and for customers willing to pay extra for this service. West End Street Railway parlor car No. 925 is one such special streetcar.\n\nThe West End Street Railway was the principal Boston-area streetcar operator in the 1890s and is the direct ancestor of today's MBTA. Early in 1894, the West End Street Railway decided to provide some luxury service for its patrons, and on March 28 of that year ordered two car bodies from the J.M. Jones Co. of Troy, NY to be outfitted as deluxe parlor cars for both official and for hire charter service. Both car bodies, numbered 924 and 925, were delivered to Boston in the late summer of 1894 where they were equipped with trucks, controllers and motors. Then, outside contractors installed the parlor car furnishings and carpeting.\n\nThe Wakefield Rattan Co., (later to become the noted transit seating firm of Heywood-Wakefield) installed twenty individual folding armchairs upholstered in blue brocaded plush. Messrs. A.H. Davenport & Co. of Boston provided heavy silk draperies in blue, and Messrs. Torrey, Bright & Capen of Boston installed carpeting. The car ceilings featured stenciled floral designs which are still in place in No. 925. Interior woodwork was mahogany. Leaded stained glass was used in the roof monitor with the words \"SPECIAL CAR\" in the end monitor glass.\n\nThe exterior color scheme was as follows: primarily dark \"bottle green\" with dark wine red or \"mahogany\" on the lower side panels, varnished sash and doors and with silver gilt striping and silver \"special car\" lettering on the end dashers. A slate grey roof and black trucks and hardware completed the scheme.\n\nThe two parlor cars made their initial public appearance with a trip on October 8th 1894 carrying West End President Samuel Little and Henry M. Whitney and other directors along with members of the press. After the inaugural trip, No. 925 went to Division Seven's Boyleston Street car house near Harvard Square.\n\nAmong the high points in the careers of Nos. 924 and 925 was the inspection trip on Aug. 25, 1897 through the completed sections of the Tremont Street subway for visiting car builder George M. Pullman and his staff and West End President Little. On February 17, 1899, the cars carried President William McKinley and members of his cabinet on a tour of the subway, leaving Park Street station at 12:15 PM.\n\nAbout 1902, the car's ends were enclosed. By the end of World War I, the once popular parlor cars were seeing little use. October 11th 1918 saw car 925 emerge from Bartlett Street shops as a money car for the Revenue Dept. wearing the overall dark green color used on all work cars. No. 924 remained in storage at Grove Hall car house. \n\nIn 1922, motor trucks replaced the money cars, and No. 925 became a fare box repair car visiting the system's car houses to service or deliver fare boxes for the Revenue Dept.\n\nBy 1927, No. 925 had been assigned to the Track Dept. as a tow car for the single truck Goldschmidt rail grinders, a duty it continued to perform until retirement early in 1954. Fortunately the interior mahogany woodwork remained, but seats were removed. About 1937, Nos. 924 and 925 were repainted in the new orange work car color. The former parlor cars survived corporate changes as the West End Street Railway became part of the Boston Elevated Railway and later the Metropolitan Transit Authority.\n\nSeashore acquired No. 925 in 1954 while No. 924 performed its final rail grinding duties and was scrapped.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Boston Trolley 925", "img_src": "697-HGfqCfQ65j9GWJ3rB0YF9C5sIzYUVlivkOZvhEd2Ohcf59uC8CzCfRfyEL52.jpg", "img_attribution": "Norman Down"}, {"img_alt": "Boston Trolley 925 interior historic photo", "img_src": "698-Rwmwp8vVfO1I5C5jZcoiuAwrgkLm68PkRfEa8PdUFkWUXYydzMCAYQD7zrlT.jpg", "img_attribution": "Interior of sister car 924 in 1896 \u2013 Fred Maloney Collection"}, {"img_alt": "Boston Trolley 925 historic photo", "img_src": "699-KxuRAjdnuI7ghBcwjo72Vx7wB9mnQYoeQ3ZVeXxoducMQHwrirvgOVd79SqA.jpg", "img_attribution": "Passengers on a charter trip in Jun 1903 - STM Curatorial Files"}]}, "10": {"technical_information": {"seats": "26", "control": "K-2", "brakes": "Hand", "compressor": "None", "trucks": {"number": "1", "manufacturer": "Brill", "model": "21E"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "3"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "29' 6.00\""}}, "title": "Manchester St. Ry. 60", "source": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "source_city": "Manchester", "source_state": "New Hampshire", "img_alt": "Manchester Trolley 60", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00060SNH.jpg", "builder": "Laconia Car Co.", "secondary_use": "Railway maintenance", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1895", "retired_from_service": "1941", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1941", "car_id": "10", "history": "The Manchester Street Railway (successor to the Manchester Horse Railway) converted from horse to electric operation in 1895 as well as converting from 3-foot gauge to standard gauge track.

This technology subsequently became the world standard. London's subway was older, but it first operated with steam locomotives and then, in 1890, with electric locomotives on the City & South London line. Following the Budapest subway, a cable-powered subway opened in Glasgow, Scotland in December 1896. The Budapest subway influenced the design of America's first subway \u2013 the Tremont Street subway in Boston which opened in 1897. \n\nBudapest's subway line ran 2.3 miles from the city center near the Danube River to the City Park to serve an exhibition commemorating the Hungary's 1000th anniversary. The Budapest Foldalatti (meaning \"underground\") line opened with 20 electrically powered cars. Nos. 1 \u2013 10 were paneled in sheet metal. Nos. 11 -19 were wood paneled, and No. 20 was a special design \"Emperor's Car.\" Forced into a 9.3 foot high tunnel between the surface and a major sewer line, the cars had an extremely low profile, and the operator had to squeeze into a very tight cab. The cars had drop centers for the doors, and the seat benches were above the trucks. Top speed was 17 mph. Over the years, the Foldalatti cars received new trucks and doors but generally kept their original appearance. The Foldalatti depressed center entrance design foreshadowed the Boston center entrance streetcars such as Nos. 6131 and 6270 now at Seashore. The Foldalatti cars were not equipped for multiple-unit operation. So, in 1960, to add capacity, Budapest acquired 16 trailer cars to operate with the original cars. In 1973, Budapest extended the Foldalatti line and finally replaced the 1896 cars with new equipment. (See also: Budapest's Foldalatti Subway and the Seashore Trolley Museum, edited by James D. Schantz, for sale in the museum bookshop.) \n\nWhen the new Foldalatti cars arrived in 1973, about half the old cars went to various museums in Europe. In 1974, Seashore Trustee George Sanborn began an attempt to obtain one of the original Budapest cars. Sanborn's letters to groups in Hungary mostly went unanswered. Sanborn hoped that President Jimmy Carter's decision to return the Crown of St. Stephen to Hungary in 1978 might generate some goodwill, but Sanborn's efforts remained unsuccessful. Finally, in 1989 while the Velvet Revolution was in process of ending Communist one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak embassy helped connect Seashore with museums in that country. The National Technical Museum in Prague, Czechoslovakia had obtained Budapest No. 18 and later transferred it to the Brno Museum of Technology in Brno, Czechoslovakia. The Brno Museum then decided to limit its collection to Czech artifacts. The museum's director agreed to donate No. 18 to Seashore in exchange for a large format Mamiya camera that was unavailable in Czechoslovakia. No. 18 was shipped to Seashore in 1991 and has been partially restored.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Budapest Subway 18", "img_src": "775-BIgG2cKCWY0WLkmxSRXSV2BfMljsU0Gs0DfhRtOopgNUW5nD9VJXxJX4ZU1S.jpg", "img_attribution": "Norman Down"}, {"img_alt": "Budapest Subway 18 historical photo", "img_src": "776-h1yFkD3lnK9q6b5FAo4kEPte2WJB5AuIT81MASeOTGwFdVe0YjDWGJ2uai9v.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister car 12 original configuration \u2013 STM Library"}]}, "12": {"technical_information": {"seats": "16", "control": "K-2", "brakes": "Hand", "compressor": "None", "trucks": {"number": "1", "manufacturer": "Brill", "model": "21E"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "General Electric", "model": "80"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "30'", "width": "7' 6.00\"", "height": "12' 6.00\"", "weight": "25500 lbs."}}, "title": "Manchester St. Ry.

The car has a small body with beveled plate glass windows and unusually large platforms with wrought iron railings. The original furnishings were light wicker chairs that could be moved from the closed section to the open platforms. The car rode on a rare, ornate truck made by the Peckham Co. of Kingston, NY. The main exterior panels were painted in royal blue with gold decorations. In the 1920s, the car fell into disuse and was placed in storage.

Besides passenger service, the CR&L provided freight service with a connection to the Boston & Maine Railroad at Claremont. At its peak, it operated 15 miles of electric lines around Claremont, NH. In 1919 the company was reorganized as the Claremont Railway. Passenger service ended in 1930. By the 1950s, it was New Hampshire's last electric line. In 1954, the Claremont & Concord Railway bought the Claremont Railway as well as the Claremont to Concord, NH branch of the Boston & Maine Railroad. Electric operation ended in1954 at the time of the acquisition. \n\nNo. 4's early history is unclear. No. 4's builder and construction date are uncertain. The CR&L began passenger service in 1903 with three combination baggage and passenger cars. A 1945 article (and later book) by D.E. Shaw reports that soon after beginning operation, the CR&L acquired three open bench cars for summer service. One was wood, single truck, monitor roof, open car No. 4. Shaw quotes the line's equipment maintainer, John Patch, remembering his rebuilding No. 4 into a line car, placing it on two arch bar trucks while retaining the same number. This rebuilding was probably between 1914 and 1920. A different account is in a 1904 Interstate-Journal article which describes the C&RL's initial equipment including a \"tower or construction\" car built by the company's master carpenter. Consistent with this account is an early photo of a single truck line car with a caption indicating that this was the first car to run over a portion of the C&RL. The body of this early line car has differences with later views of No. 4, but No. 4 may have been rebuilt from the original line car. \n\nThe C&RL originally identified its non-passenger equipment with letters instead of numbers. No. 4 may have initially been lettered \"D.\" \n\nIn 1955, the Claremont & Concord's president, Samuel Pinsley, donated No. 4, without its trucks, to Seashore. The C&C scrapped No. 4's arch-bar trucks. The Claremont & Concord also sent Claremont Ry. flat car No. 1 to Seashore. (Seashore later scrapped the flat car.) Seashore initially used the body of No. 4 as a storage shed. In 1959, the museum installed two type-5 trucks from a former Boston Elevated streetcar and used it for a limited amount of wire maintenance. However, the car did not operate well, and, in 1964, it went into storage. \n\nOn October 17, 1969, Boston's MBTA damaged its line car No. 3283 in a lethal collision with motor flat No. 2026. (Both No. 3283 and No. 2026 are now at Seashore.) The MBTA needed a replacement line car to maintain overhead wire on the Green Line while No. 3283 was being repaired. So, Seashore leased No. 4 to the MBTA as a replacement, believed to be the first time a museum vehicle moved back to regular operation. Only six days after the accident, No. 4 was at the MBTA's Everett shops, a sign of the close working relationship between the MBTA and the museum. During three weeks at the Everett shops, the MBTA extensively modified No. 4. The MBTA installed a fixed roof platform, flood lights on the roof, new side doors and a new wire reel mounted inside. The MBTA painted the car gray with \"T\" symbols while retaining the number \"4.\" After repairing its regular wire car, the MBTA returned No. 4 to the museum in December 1970. \n\nIn 1974, Seashore replaced the MBTA's fixed roof platform with a hoisting platform from Portsmouth Dover & York No. 108, and, in 1975, Seashore installed a swinging tower. In September 1975, Seashore again loaned No. 4 to the MBTA to help speed up conversion of the Green Line for pantograph operation. In compensation, the MBTA rebuilt the traction motors in Seashore's line car S-71. The MBTA repainted the car in its yellow work car scheme. No. 4 returned to Seashore in January 1979. Before its service in Boston, Seashore had painted No. 4 silver and later brown. In 1989, Seashore painted No. 4 in a dark green Claremont Ry. scheme.

The line, completed in 1900, ran 44 miles from Rochester, NY to Sodus Bay, NY and Sodus Point, NY. When built, it was the world's longest interurban. In 1909, New York State Railways acquired the R&SB, but the R&SB retained its own identity. New York State Railways also owned three other interurbans as well as several local streetcar operations in the state. New York State Railways was itself owned by the New York Central Railroad. The R&SB produced little traffic except for travel to resorts in the Sodus Bay area in the summer. The R&SB painted its cars royal blue and was known as the \"Royal Blue Line.\" Jackson & Sharp built 9 wood cars for the R&SB in 1899. In 1900, the R&SB purchased six more wood, monitor-roof cars from Jackson & Sharp, Nos 70 -75. In 1911, the R&SB rebuilt and renumbered its fleet. No. 74 became No. 113. In 1928, the city of Rochester opened a trolley subway in the former Erie Canal bed. The subway was used by several interurban lines serving the city, but the R&SB was the only interurban without a connection to the subway. The R&SB was abandoned in 1929 except for a short section close to Rochester which ran until 1933. \n\nAfter retirement from the R&SB, No. 113 became the day room of the Wright-on-the-Lake trailer camp on the shore of Lake Ontario at Webster, NY. Mrs. Erva Wright Smith, eventual owner of the trailer park, became a great Seashore supporter. In 1989, wheelchair bound, Ms. Smith enlisted the support of both the local historical society and the volunteer fire department to help move No. 113. This was one of the best outpourings of local support ever enjoyed by a Seashore project anywhere. Seats were found in a nearby barn, and correct Taylor trucks were obtained from a wrecked car (Niagara St. Catherines & Toronto Ry. No. 130) at the Rail City Museum at Sandy Creek, NY. (Some news accounts at the time reported the car as No. 114.) No. 113 is the oldest interurban car at Seashore and possibly the oldest preserved interurban anywhere. It is Seashore's only car built by Jackson & Sharp, an important, early builder.

It is the oldest surviving Brill design electric open car. The car rides on Brill's patented 22E \"maximum traction\" trucks. This design featured two large wheels mounted on the axle driven by the motor and two small \"pony\" wheels on the other axle. The truck was designed to throw more weight on the motored axle so that maximum traction might be obtained without spinning the wheels. Gone from most of the big cities by the 1920s, open cars survived in areas where their capacity made their short operating season financially viable. One such area was the cities of Biddeford and Saco in Maine, where the local trolley line served the resort town of Old Orchard Beach. Ridership to Old Orchard was insufficient to fill a twice hourly Birney Car for nine months out of the year, but ballooned to enormous traffic during the summer. The summer loads often required double-headed 12 bench opens running on a 15 minute headway. In the spring of 1939, a group of college age men from the Boston area, chartered cars and spent the day riding back and forth between Biddeford and Old Orchard. Buses were already on order to replace the streetcars, and while riding an open car, one was heard saying \"Someone ought to save one of these cars.\" Someone else chimed in, \"Why can't it be us?\" Lively discussion ensued, and by the time the trip was over, a decision had been made to try and purchase the car they were riding in, No. 31.\n\nThe Biddeford & Saco agreed to sell the car for $150, provided that the purchasers removed the car from the cities within a fixed time period after trolley service ended. Facing several obstacles, including raising the $150, this group of men managed to raise the price of the car plus the cost of moving it, leased a small plot of land off Log Cabin Road on the Arundel-Kennebunkport border, and succeeded in moving the car over the road about eight miles using makeshift equipment. The purchase was made on July 5, 1939, on the same day that buses replaced the cars. Thus was born the Seashore Trolley Museum, and, in general, street railway preservation. In 1979, Senator Edmund Muskie rode No. 39 at the celebration of the museum's 40th anniversary.

Because the body on these cars was 25 feet long, excluding the open platforms at each end, they were classed as a \"25 foot box cars.\" Car 396 served the North Beacon Street line in Brighton and Watertown from 1900 until it was replaced by a Birney car around 1920. As a Division 7 car it was painted crimson. When built, No. 396 had open platforms, but the vestibules were enclosed between 1901 and 1905 as mandated by a 1900 state law. It was repainted in crimson, and later repainted in The Boston El's standard paint scheme of dark green and white without any striping or decoration. In 1923, the Boston Elevated converted No. 396 to an electrical test car. It was later painted solid green and solid orange as a work car. No. 396 remained in service when the Metropolitan Transit Authority acquired the Boston Elevated in 1947. [See also: \"West End Street Ry. Divisions and Paint Schemes\" on the museum website.] \n\nNo. 396 is one of seven cars purchased at a special price in 1954 when the MTA ended its previous policy of requiring the museum to pay at least junk value for vehicles. The car remained a relatively obscure part of Seashore's collection until 1963, when the Otto Preminger production company came to Seashore, seeking a Boston trolley typical of the early 1900s. No. 396 was chosen, and the MTA's Everett Shops was contracted to bring the car back to its appearance in 1912. Though not perfect, the overall appearance was good. After operating on Belmont St., on the Waverley line for its scenes in The Cardinal, No. 396 returned to Maine where it became a popular car for display and occasional operation. During the 1980s, Seashore decided to return the car to a more accurate paint scheme, that which it wore from 1905 to about 1915, running on the North Beacon St. line. Remnants of this scheme, inside the vestibules, had survived the last years in green, the work car years and the 1963 repainting. Fresh crimson was applied, with white on the concave panels, but before the striping could be applied, Hollywood intervened again.\n\nIn 1977, the Children's Television Workshop requested the car for a piece in The Best of Families, a miniseries depicting a Brooklyn, NY family. Trolleys were important in Brooklyn's history, and 396 represented the period they wished to depict. The crimson paint was a good match for Brooklyn's maroon, but the 1905 era vestibules were removed to depict the proper era in Brooklyn. The scenes depicting the Brooklyn trolley strike of 1895 were shot at Boston's Reservoir Carhouse. Before No. 396 returned to Maine, the MBTA also used the car for an event depicting four generations of Boston streetcars to publicize the purchase of new LRVs. In 1996, the MBTA proposed bringing No. 396 back to Boston for a display marking the Boston subway centennial, but this move was not done.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Small green trolley interior", "img_src": "447-lvRPnPevUGQEYcn77I1oj76dO8FQC6f9llPXu7ItCeKP1arovLfxJN9bJql7.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

In addition, another large operator, the Connecticut Railway and Light Co., serving Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, Ansonia-Derby, New Britain and Waterbury was leased. These fourteen cities formed the basis for thirteen operating divisions, each of which maintained its own roster of cars. On August 1, 1915 a new numbering system was introduced by the Connecticut Co. which renumbered all of its cars into a single sequence. Cars from a single order assigned to various divisions were kept together numerically, with a few minor exceptions. For that reason, each of Seashore's Connecticut Co. cars has had two numbers.\n\nCar 303 was originally purchased by the Winchester Avenue Railroad Co. of New Haven in 1901. Ownership passed to the Consolidated Railway Co. in 1904 and to the Connecticut Co. in 1907. All these companies had ties or were owned by the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. In the general renumbering of 1915 it became car 615. Long after the Connecticut Co. withdrew open cars, such as No. 303/615, from regular service, the company used them in New Haven to shuttle football fans between the railroad station and the Yale Bowl on game days. The open cars also continued operating on excursions to the local beaches and on charter service including fan trips. The Yale service, however, was the reason these cars were not scrapped in the 1930s or earlier when many other systems scrapped their open cars. The last Yale Bowl open cars ran in the 1947 football season, and all New Haven streetcar service ended in 1948. A number of these open cars were donated to museums. \n\nMuseum Ownership: The Seashore Trolley Museum acquired four Connecticut Co. open cars (615, 838, 1253 and 1468) . The museum initially moved (under their own power) two of these cars (1468 & 838) to store them at the newly established Branford Electric Railway Association's museum before movement to Kennebunkport. The others were moved directly to Maine. Seashore also helped to move other open cars to the Connecticut Electric Railway Association in East Windsor CT. The Seashore Trolley Museum decided to restore this car as No. 303 to avoid confusion with Portland Railroad single truck Birney No. 615 also at the museum. This also allowed for the use of a more elaborate paint scheme than that used in 1915. (The current paint scheme is of the 1911-1914 period.) The museum also temporarily installed a PK automatic control system on the car about 1970, and removed it in 1996. This involved a plan to operate this car in multiple unit with car 1468, which has never been restored. The Connecticut Company had MU open cars of the 1100 series but there is no evidence that the cars were ever used in MU service. Despite being our oldest 15 bench open car, No. 303 is also the most solidly built. After a fire destroyed No. 1253, Seashore acquired former Connecticut Co. No. 1391, thus maintaining a fleet of four New Haven open cars. Over the years, 303 has been a constant workhorse in the museum's operating fleet.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Yellow trolley 303", "img_src": "709-rhW73Dr6FgiyaCiYETgbwhTGltoz2jsheM77XSCJdXkXm5obrrWWyzWAx0km.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando on 02/08/2020"}, {"img_alt": "Yellow trolley 303", "img_src": "710-jixTGHT9nYaqc034RY6hEl2LjKBF9uqV8Xsl0DeJ8ixymFZiEa2xiLC0m6Oy.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando on 02/08/2020"}, {"img_alt": "Yellow trolley 303", "img_src": "711-EXIDRa58UdVCkQAQCPYyPEcUOKp3YkMqaqYM9h2NYm1vhgayoqkfvuXgAuDd.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando on 03/21/20"}, {"img_alt": "Yellow trolley 303 historic photo", "img_src": "712-zZTxFtqdRiaD0hZAccwWbUne3Dnuut0RiBZvAbmVIC94pLEVwcA0JKxkzCnn.jpg", "img_attribution": "Roger Sommers"}]}, "18": {"technical_information": {"seats": "26", "brakes": "Hand", "compressor": "None", "trucks": {"number": "1", "manufacturer": "Be,is"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "29' 6.00\"", "weight": "12000 lbs."}}, "title": "Lexington & Boston St. Ry. 41", "source": "Massachusetts", "source_city": "Massachusetts", "source_state": "USA", "img_alt": "Trolley 41 historic photo", "img_attribute": "John L.

John Stephenson Car Co. built these cars prior to Brill's absorption of the Stephenson Company. The Lexington & Boston cars had a single truck and a railroad roof \u2013 an unusual combination. The L&B painted its cars dark blue with gold trim. A photo shows L&B No. 41 signed for the Lexington and Woburn route. Sometime between 1905 and 1912, the L&B installed steel panels on No. 41's upper side panels.\n\nThe Middlesex & Boston Street Railway was formed in 1899 to acquire the small street railways in the Boston suburbs. In 1912, the M&B acquired the Lexington & Boston. The M&B became the third largest street railway in Massachusetts. It operated lines from Lexington to Lowell and to connections with the Boston Elevated streetcar lines near the Boston city boundary. The M&B also served Norumbega Park in West Newton. The M&B assigned No. 41 to its Natick Division with routes to Wellesley and Needham, MA. The M&B painted No. 41 in its maroon and cream colors. By 1921, the M&B placed No. 41 in storage. \n\nIn 1927, the M&B sold No. 41 to Ray McGowan, who converted it into a diner in Natick, MA known as \"Ray's Lunch.\" McGowan purchased No. 41 without its truck and electrical gear. In 1937, McGowan enclosed No. 41 in a larger building. Customers at Ray's Lunch included Boston Braves baseball players. McGowan banned mobster James \"Whitey\" Bolger after Bolger insulted McGowan's wife at the diner. After World War II, the car became a gift store. When further development of the property threatened No. 41, C. David Perry purchased the car and then donated it to Seashore in 1962. Seashore stored No. 41 outdoors until moving it into the Fairview barn in 1978. Douglas Carrier, a museum member, began a program to raise money for No. 41's restoration in the late 1990's. The McGowan family has supported the museum's restoration of No. 41, and Seashore will honor the McGowan family with a plaque on the restored car. Seashore has accomplished significant restoration work since moving No. 41 into the restoration shop in 2010. The museum is restoring No. 41 to its 1912 appearance prior to its painting in the M&B colors. \n\nNo. 41 came to Seashore without trucks. A builder's photo of twin No. 37 shows that Stephenson built the cars with a Bemis 203 truck. Seashore located one of these trucks from a Norway & Paris Street Railway car. The truck had been left in a swamp after that line was abandoned. It is being extensively rebuilt and equipped with some motors from Japan so that it may be placed under No. 41.

In 1901, the Boston Elevated Railway Company opened its \"Main Line\" elevated extending from Sullivan Square north of downtown to Dudley Square station in South Boston. This station was located along Washington Street between Massachusetts Avenue and Northampton Street in Boston's South End. Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr., a prominent Boston architect and nephew of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, designed Northampton Station as well as nine other, identical stations for the line. The elegant station has a copper exterior over a steel frame. When in service, the station and elevated tracks stood on steel supports above the street traffic, leaving Washington Street in perpetual shadow. Neighborhood residents, however, appreciated the fast service to downtown; in the 1920s, an estimated 14,500 passengers a day boarded trains at Northampton Station.\n\nThe orange sign on the station dates from 1965 when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), having taken over Boston's transit system, applied color codes to each rapid transit line. The Main Line elevated became the Orange Line. In 1987, the MBTA rerouted the Orange Line to new tracks below street level several blocks west of the old elevated line. So, the MBTA tore down the elevated tracks and stations along Washington Street, except for Northampton Street station. Unlike most of the other el stations, Northampton Street had remained little changed from its 1901 appearance. Seashore was awarded the station for preservation after winning a three way competition. Moving this 97-ton structure to the museum was one of the most challenging moves undertaken by Seashore. The moving project took a year, from the summer of 1989 to the summer of 1990. The station moved on dollies through the streets of Boston to the Boston waterfront and then on a former oil rig supply ship to Colony Beach in Kennebunkport. For the final five miles by truck to the museum, Seashore crews needed to remove the station's roof so that the building would fit below utility wires over the streets on the final 5.5 miles to the museum. Seashore reassembled the station here.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Northampton Elevated Station from Boston", "img_src": "498-HEZ5PgK1LOHmDB2IkGkayPyWrXNSsGNBcRbrg94p6s7CBfIYRnoRBTyMYoIM.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

From its erection in 1901 until 1938, the tower controlled movements of \"El\" trains at a busy three-way intersection. Trains coming from the subway under downtown Boston passed the tower en route to Charlestown and Everett. Trains from South Station passed via Atlantic Avenue on their way to North Station, and other trains originating in Roxbury also swung past the tower when leaving Atlantic Avenue and heading for Charlestown.\n\nA switchman stationed on the upper level of Tower C would observe the configuration of marker lights on an approaching train to determine the direction desired. He would then operate levers which operated pneumatic lines which aligned the track switches. Once aligned and the way was clear, he sounded two blasts on the tower whistle to signal the train was safe to proceed.\n\nAfter the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was abandoned in 1938, the tower remained, but largely without function as the remaining trains simply curved past the tower. In 1975 when the Orange Line was diverted to a new subway, the Charlestown El was slated for demolition. The Museum obtained the tower, then moved it to Maine by sea. A giant crane lifted the tower to a trailer which carried it to the middle of the nearby Charlestown bridge, from which it was lowered onto a barge. A tug brought it to Kennebunkport Harbor, where it was cut horizontally, then driven to the Museum on two trailers. Once here it was craned off and reassembled.\n\nThe design and construction of the tower represents the architectural style employed throughout the Elevated lines built by the Boston Elevated Railway Company. The design was the product of architect Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, a nephew of the famed poet. All stations and service structures featured copper sheathing seen on Tower C, with the finely detailed decoration and distinctive peaked roofs. The care nd expense with these structures were built demonstrated the pride taken by turn of the century builders in this advanced form of transportation. Northampton Station from the Roxbury elevated in Boston is also at the Museum and shares the same architectural design.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "The letter \u2018C\u2019 on Tower", "img_src": "520-blDXtapGTDAysZ1EkOaGmdgfxwxqrp2QShCaXj3eBu2wi8Hmhy1bjhaRVvfF.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister car 200 in Philadelphia suburbs in 02/1971 - Joe Testagrose at newdavesrailpix.com"}, {"img_alt": "Green Control Tower", "img_src": "521-KcesPR82z70ERYKRysjkhfldkJvlDQszN4kvrIAW1Gz1upjOGqxotUr5VEp4.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando on 12/11/20"}, {"img_alt": "Green Control Tower", "img_src": "522-3KV8ggd3tpKacDSB4yLdwnNBUv1eIvwTX1JGDHY8pXkBNRnieHRZ1VtUYvfc.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando on 12/11/20"}, {"img_alt": "Green Control Tower historic photo", "img_src": "523-4KdlXcrnTyvPR2oUWB2EuFserIcFoFMwWJjH6ri7saed5BbI496wQT0X05ui.jpg", "img_attribution": "Paul Kehoe at Causeway St & N.

Some had swivel trucks at either end of the carbody even as this configuration was just beginning to be adopted for regular service street railway equipment. Among the most splendid was the Berkshire Hills , built in 1902 by the Wason Manufacturing Company of Springfield, Massachusetts. It was ordered by the Berkshire Street Railway, a regional trolley system in that bucolic region of Western Massachusetts. Consolidation with connecting companies reaching into Vermont, Connecticut and New York would make the Berkshire Street Railway the only trolley company to operate in four states.\n\nThe Berkshire Hills was greatly appointed with Santo Domingo mahogany cabinetry and woodwork, curved and beveled glass, ornate light fixtures, opulent draperies and costly upholstery on its wicker chairs. The car was used largely for charters, but was also used for premium fare summer service from Pittsfield, the only major city of the region, to Cheshire, Connecticut and later to Bennington, Vermont. World War I ended the parlor service and the Berkshire Hills saw only a few charters until it was placed in storage in 1922.\n\nThe car was ultimately sold in 1932, at about the time the Berkshire Street Railway ended all electric rail service. The electrical and running gear was sold and scrapped separately, and the carbody was set out alongside Route 20 in West Pittsfield for use as a diner. Over the years, the diner's managements and usages changed. After some years as a landmark, the car was encased in a brick wall that made it unrecognizable, though little damage was done o the overall structure, until a 1994 fire in an attached building did substantial damage to the interior appointments, which has survived remarkably well until then.\n\nThe problem of removing the brick wall and anticipated costs of replacing it for ongoing possible uses had frustrated latter day efforts to save the Berkshire Hills and restore to as a street railway parlor car. After the fire, the owner was suddenly quite willing to donate the parlor car to Seashore. A curatorial party from Seashore inspected the property and reported that the Berkshire Hills , although gravely wounded was still far from dead, and that the carbody was still sound and restorable, though more expensively than before.\n\nArea supporters and contractors were found who would extract and transport the carbody. Sufficient funds were generated in the Berkshire region to meet moving costs and defray a last minute demand for substantial money to rebuild the brick wall that was still going to have to be torn down, and the Berkshire Hills was plucked from its tomb and loaded for transport, finally arriving in Maine on March 13, 1995.\n\nHistoric Cars: The National Collection at the Seashore Trolley Museum by Ben Minnich", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Parlor Car Berkshire Hills interior historic photo", "img_src": "751-vIPRJDcGZa2fh73uUXkgXZYLasS07BZMESmtci2kcF5xGa0jopkCVtt6VH3E.jpg", "img_attribution": "Interior \u2013 Bill Volkmer Collectyion at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "21": {"technical_information": {"seats": "32", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Laconia", "model": "8B"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "35' 4.00\""}}, "title": "Mass.

Massachusetts Northeastern served the region between Newburyport, MA and Nashua, NH and had almost as much track in New Hampshire as it had in Massachusetts. Car 50 ran most of the time between Haverhill, MA and Amesbury, MA via Plaistow, NH and Newton, NH. In the summer, this line extended east of Amesbury to Hampton Beach, NH. The car was an early design popular in New England. When built, it had both transverse and longitudinal seats as it was to be used largely in suburban service where passengers rode longer distances than in the city. Most city cars at the time had all longitudinal seating, but within a few years, the seating configuration found in No. 50 became standard for city cars as well with longitudinal seats only at the ends.

No. 105 (originally No. 5) was built for the Mornington Borough Council in 1903 to replace older cars destroyed in a fire. No. 105 was designed for one-man operation which was very unusual for a cable car. The 3' 6\" gauge car carried 18 passengers at 8 to 10 miles per hour. The short car was equipped with a single truck. The City Corporation Tramways of Dunedin took over the operation in 1916. No. 105 ran on the city's Maryhill line most of its life. The Maryhill line was only a half-mile long. Locals sometimes referred to it as \"the Big Dipper,\" going steeply down one side of a valley and then up the other side. After the Maryhill line closed in 1955, No. 105 moved to the Mornington line, Dunedin's last operating cable route. The Mornington line included a 28 percent grade, one of the steepest cable grades in the world. No. 105 had a \"convertible\" grip which could be set at two different heights to allow it to run of either line. Cable car service ended in 1957, making Dunedin the last city, other than San Francisco, to operate cable cars. \n\n\n\nDunedin had been a favorite liberty port for thousands of American G.I.s in the South Pacific during World War II. So, in 1957, the City of Dunedin donated No. 105 to the United States for custody by Seashore in memory of U.S. naval, marine and army personnel. No. 105 came to the U.S. in January 1958 on New Zealand Shipping Company's M.V. Wangaroa. No. 105 was exhibited at the New England Sportsmen's and Boat Show at Boston's Mechanics Hall. On February 3, during the show, Sir Leslie Munro, New Zealand's ambassador to the U.S. and former president of the United Nations General Assembly, ceremonially presented No. 105 to Governor Foster Furcolo of Massachusetts and A. Edward Langlois, representing Governor Edmund Muskie of Maine. For lunch on Feb. 3, Seashore members organized an informal state luncheon at Boston's Hotel Statler for Sir Leslie and Lady Monro, Governor Furcolo and representatives of the British Commonwealth nations, the U.S. armed forces and New England businesses. A marine-navy color guard and Scots bagpipers welcomed the luncheon guests. At the presentation ceremony, Sir Leslie gave Mr. Langlois the original cable hook from the car. After the Sportsmen's show, No. 105 was trucked to Seashore. No. 105 is one of two cable cars at Seashore; the other is California Street Cable Railroad No. 48. At 16' 6\" long, No. 105 is Seashore's smallest rail passenger vehicle.

In 1897, the Boston Elevated also took over streetcar lines in Boston. Newburyport Car Manufacturing Co. built No. 475 for the Boston Elevated in 1903. The basic layout of No. 475 duplicates No. 396 which is also at Seashore Trolley Museum. Unlike No. 396, No. 475 was constructed originally with enclosed vestibules. It was also one of the first 60 Boston streetcars equipped with air brakes. No. 475 has the so called \"Boston Front\" \u2013 each dasher having three panels matching the three vestibule windows above. This group of 60 cars is termed the 26 \u00bd foot cars.\n\nThe BERy assigned No. 475 to Division 9 serving Brighton, Allston and Brookline. Division 9's paint scheme was chocolate brown and white. In 1904, No. 475 may have been part of a group of 26 \u00bd ft. cars used on the East Boston tunnel where steep grades required air brake cars for safe operation. After 1911, No. 475 received the standard surface lines colors of dark green and white. Boston Elevated converted No. 475 to one man operation in 1922. The car ran in many parts of the city. Newer semi-convertible cars led to a relatively short life in regular service for No. 475. Boston Elevated rebuilt No. 475 into an electrical test car in 1928. The BERy based its work cars at Charlestown Neck. Other 26 \u00bd foot cars were gone by 1930. No. 475 received an orange paint scheme in the late 1930s. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 475 in 1952. In 1979, Seashore moved No. 475 to the MBTA Watertown carhouse where a group of Boston area volunteers could do restoration work. In 1980, No. 475 moved to the Lotus Place carhouse at Arborway. The next year, it was back at Watertown. At Watertown, Seashore volunteers did extensive restoration work, including removing the test equipment and reinstalling longitudinal seats.

Industrial Works was established in 1873, and became the world's leading manufacturer of large lifting cranes. For a long time, it was the only manufacturer of large lifting cranes in the United States. In 1931, it merged with Brown Hoisting Company of Cleveland, Ohio, becoming the Industrial Brownhoist Corporation. In 1960, it was sold to the American Hoist Corporation of Minneapolis, and became known as the Industrial Brownhoist Division of the American Hoist Corporation. The plant at Bay City was closed for good in 1983, ending 110 years of manufacturing at that location. No. 0504 was one of three electric craned built by Industrial Work for the Boston Elevated Railway. \n\nElectric cranes, as opposed to the steam cranes prevalent at the time, were ideal because they were immediately ready for work, not having to wait to fire up and make steam. Also, the service of a fireman was not needed. No. 0504 was not self-propelled and had to be propelled to the job sites. Power to operate the electric crane was transmitted through collector shoes on the trucks which made contact with the 3rd rail of the elevated line. The crane's capacity was rated at 10 tons. It spent most of its career travelling in the company of wrecker car No. 0210, a converted passenger car. \n\nNumber 0504 was involved in the cleanup of The Beach Street Elevated Wreck of July 22, 1928. A four car elevated train jumped the track a sharp curve at Beach Street and Harrison Avenue killing two people and injuring several others.

(The PD&Y did not give the car a number; about 1909, the Atlantic Shore Line numbered it 108.) No. 108 was a railway post office car similar to those operated on the steam railroads, with additional space provided for baggage and express. As a railway post office car, postal clerks on board the car sorted and cancelled mail while picking up and dropping off mail at points along the way. The PD&Y had been carrying mail between Portsmouth, NH and York Beach, ME since 1898, originally using a smaller car. Mail went by ferry on the Portsmouth, NH \u2013 Kittery, ME portion of the route. The mail car was delivered in a red and white paint scheme, but the PD&Y subsequently painted it a dark green. \n\nThe PD&Y became part of the Atlantic Shore Line system in 1906. The ASL operated a system of trolley lines in southern Maine, including the route now used by Seashore's demonstration railway. No. 108 regularly operated on the York Beach \u2013 Portsmouth RPO route. In 1918, No. 108 derailed on a trestle between Kittery and York and fell on its side in ice. This accident ended the mail contract. In 1919, No. 108 was repaired and converted to a line car for overhead wire maintenance. When ASL abandoned most of its operations in the 1920s, portions continued to operate as York Utilities Co. York Utilities ran a line between Sanford, ME and Kennebunkport until 1927, and the last line between Sanford and Springvale, ME ran until 1949. No. 108 may have originally operated with only hand brakes. York Utilities installed air brakes and also installed larger trucks and knuckle couplers. One job for No. 108 was removing the wire from the line which eventually became Seashore's operating route. [See also: \"Atlantic Shore Line Railway\" on museum website.] \n\t\nSeashore acquired No. 108 in 1949 and did repainting and other restoration work on the car in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Seashore used No. 108 as a line car including using it to restore overhead wire to the line where No. 108 had removed it in the 1920s. Seashore did a more complete restoration in 1973-1983, converting it from a line car back to an RPO car. Later, Seashore installed a larger air compressor for the brakes. No. 108, along with Union Street Railway No. 34, ran as an active railway post office on October 8, 1983 for the streetcar postage stamp first day of issue ceremony officiated by then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and Postmaster General William Bolger. In the 2000s, Seashore used the car to carry pumpkins for Pumpkin Patch weekends. No. 108 is one of very few surviving trolley RPO cars. In 1980, the National Park Service has placed No. 108 on the National Register of Historic Place along with nine of the museum's other Maine cars.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "US Mail Trolley", "img_src": "830-ruJnzS45ORQYl0xlDJYYxZRSlhjwftcOWNZAywrlcuD7BO4r81y8maTS8fj4.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

It also leased New York's Metropolitan Elevated system. When the subway was being designed, the issue of safety was important, since most of the line would be in tunnels. Although the initial equipment for the line would be of composite steel-wood construction, the company embarked on a program to develop an all-steel car which would be both fire and collision resistant. Engineers had previously believed that a car would come apart under the stresses of vehicle operation unless it contained at least some wood to absorb shocks. At the time, the Pennsylvania Railroad was planning to build Pennsylvania Station in New York City. PRR President Alexander Cassatt also wanted the safety of an all-steel car for the tunnels needed to reach the new station which was to open in 1910. Cassatt made an offer to August Belmont Jr., President of the IRT, to build a sample steel car for the subway. After the IRT tested this prototype all-steel car designed by Pennsylvania Railroad Mechanical Engineer George Gibbs, it ordered 300 similar production cars from American Car & Foundry (ACF). These cars, Nos. 3350-3649, were termed High-Voltage (Hi-V) \"Gibbs\" cars and came in 1904-05. ACF built No. 3352 in June 1904, and the IRT fitted out the car in August 1904. The IRT subway opened on October 27, 1904, and No. 3352 entered service a few days later on October 30, 1904. The steel cars' performance immediately rendered all wood framed vehicles obsolete. The PRR and other railroads then began building all-steel cars. \n\nOn the night of December 4, 1907, No. 3352 was the lead car in an empty, stationary train. Another train, also with no passengers, moving at 30 to 40 m.p.h., collided with No. 3352's train. Because of No. 3352's steel anti-climbers, it sustained only minor damage. Other cars on both trains were wood-steel composite cars without anti-climbers. These cars telescoped in the collision and suffered serious damage. This incident helped establish the safety benefits of all-steel construction and the use of steel anti-climbers.\n\nThe IRT's Hi-V cars were similar to the company's elevated cars with doors at the ends and 16 transverse seats at the center of the body. In 1910-12, the IRT added pneumatically operated center doors to improve passenger flow. The end doors remained manually operated by a conductor. The Hi-V cars used 600 DC voltage from the third rail for the motorman's propulsion control while IRT cars built beginning in 1915, called \"Low-Voltage cars,\" used 32 volts from a battery for the motorman's controller.\n\nIn 1940, the City of New York acquired Interborough Rapid Transit and operated the IRT lines as well as the BMT and IND systems under the New York City Board of Transportation. In 1953, the city formed the New York City Transportation Authority to operate the subways. The NYCTA ordered new cars to replace its oldest equipment. This program included the R-22 cars, such as No. 7371 now also at Seashore, to operate on the IRT lines and replace the Hi-V cars. No. 3352 ran in daily service for over a half a century and had to be called in off a regular train in 1956 to be sent to Maine. \n\nIn 1956, the New York City Board of Estimate passed a resolution to sell former Brooklyn Rapid Transit #4547 and a Hi-V car to Seashore for $1 each. Seashore selected No. 3352 for preservation as it was the oldest Hi-V car remaining at the time. During the 1960s, Seashore began restoration of No. 3352, rebuilding its body without the center door. In order to operate the car on museum trackage, Seashore installed trolley poles. Although exterior restoration is largely complete, significant interior work remains to be accomplished. No. 3352 is the only surviving car from the production run of the world's first all-steel vehicles and is the world's oldest existing all-steel railcar. As such, former Seashore Historian Ben Minnich called this car the most historically significant car in the Seashore collection.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "drawing of front end, car 3354, about 1903", "img_src": "343-bbrIBgGXgp8FXlu5F85sb0muenltwJFqfWDFwG67necXRwhXSBspAiKUtcdb.jpg", "img_attribution": "1903 drawing of end of car from wikipedia (public domain)"}, {"img_alt": "Side elecation and interior drawings of car 3352", "img_src": "516-9AWdhnqNTIhdv6botgQieXaTZrN0BhSa5H3BbhtTChqok09yE5l2QJSkyhdK.jpg", "img_attribution": "Roger Arca drawing of car 3352 dated 1904"}, {"img_alt": "New York Subway Car 3352", "img_src": "518-Ek41RAMjpni2FzyRKZaFmB9svGTN2kxaZbPskkF3RCkU8AnBfjv9DBAFYgmo.jpg", "img_attribution": "James Tebbetts on 10/15/2020"}]}, "26": {"technical_information": {"seats": "75", "control": "K-28", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Laconia", "model": "9B"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "General Electric", "model": "70"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "43'", "width": "8'"}}, "title": "Newport & Providence Ry.

It is an example of a double ended, single truck shear snow plow to be used on double track to plow the snow to the right. Unfortunately, it proved itself better at shoving itself off the tracks than shoving the snow. The Rhode Island Company was created to lease the operation of the United Traction and Electric Company, which included streetcar lines in Providence as well as the suburban lines running through Cumberland, Pawtucket Valley, Barrington, and Warren. In 1907, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad gained control of RICo. But antitrust laws soon forced the railroad out of the state, leaving the Rhode Island Company without the financial support of the larger company. It now had to face crushing debts and increasing competition from automobiles and jitneys on its own, which proved too much. In 1918, the Rhode Island Supreme Court cancelled its leases and RICo went into bankruptcy. In 1919 the United Electric Railways was chartered and assumed control of Rhode Island Company. UER was put under the control of the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission to protect service from any disruption from financial difficulties. During the Great Depression, UER suffered from deferred maintenance and service reductions, and buses began to replace the trolleys. By 1948, the trolleys were completely replaced by trolleybuses. The Seashore Trolley Museum acquired Number 16 on June 7th, 1948. It was stored at the Edaville Railroad in South Carver, MA, along with Union Street Railway Mail Car No. 34. While there, volunteer members painted the entire outside including the roof and repaired the trolley base. The plow blades were ground down and sprayed with rust resistant paint. In the years prior to 1976, the sides and roof have been painted several times and 100 linear feet of new matchboard has been milled to replace deteriorated pieces.

In addition, another large operator, the Connecticut Railway and Light Co., serving Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, Ansonia-Derby, New Britain and Waterbury was leased. These fourteen cities formed the basis for thirteen operating divisions, each of which maintained its own roster of cars. The Connecticut Co. and its predecessors had ties or were owned by the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. In 1915, the company renumbered all of its cars into a single sequence. Cars from a single order assigned to various divisions were kept together numerically, with a few minor exceptions. For that reason, each of Seashore's Connecticut Co. cars has had two numbers. \n\nThis is the most distinctive of our Connecticut opens, built in 1905 by the J. M. Jones car company of West Troy (now Watervliet), NY. (Some sources show the build date as 1904 or 1906.) Features of this car include its steamcoach roof, two 65 horsepower motors in place of 4 40 horsepower versions, an unusual lighting circuit, and trolley hooks which guide the pole into place. The roofline was adopted as a simpler surface to maintain than the earlier deck roof, but the deck roof returned when rollsigns were adopted. This car was No. 381 when built and was renumbered to No. 838 in 1915. \n \nLong after the Connecticut Co. withdrew open cars, such as No. 838, from regular service, the company used them in New Haven to shuttle football fans between the railroad station and the Yale Bowl on game days. The open cars also continued operating on excursions to the local beaches and on charter service including fan trips. The Yale service (along with the available extra space to store the cars at the James Street Car Barn upper level) was, however, the reason these cars were not scrapped in the 1930s or earlier when many other systems scrapped their open cars. The last Yale Bowl open cars ran in the 1947 football season, and all New Haven streetcar service ended in 1948. A number of these open cars were donated to museums. \n\nThe Seashore Trolley Museum acquired four Connecticut Co. open cars (615, 838, 1253 and 1468) . The museum initially moved (under their own power) two of these cars (1468 & 838) to store them at the newly established Branford Electric Railway Association's museum before movement to Kennebunkport. The others were moved directly to Maine. Seashore also helped to move other open cars to the Connecticut Electric Railway Association in East Windsor CT. After a fire destroyed No. 1253, Seashore acquired former Connecticut Co. No. 1391, thus maintaining a fleet of four New Haven open cars. No. 838 long held the all-time record for car mileage at Seashore, though it took a back seat to No. 303 when it was taken out of service in 2005 for needed sill work. No. 838 returned to service for a few years and then was removed again in 2009 for a major body and mechanical upgrade including rehabilitation of one of its two motors. The body exterior of No. 838 was repainted and the interior flip over seats were refinished, and the ceiling had new birch paneling installed.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Yellow 838 Trolley with passengers", "img_src": "354-dmyqhTYPceqCyruP2h8KB8v8LvFpPG4DRaYg9IEBkZiqpJlE4uuSXwufyyHZ.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

The observation cars were so successful that two more such cars were eventually constructed 1924. In 1954, a three-window front windshield was installed on each observation car. All four operated sightseeing tours around Montreal until 1957, and were available for charter for another year. The sightseeing cars were considered too iconic to scrap.

Boston did not open its first elevated line until 1901. Boston Elevated Railway's Main Line Elevated (approximating the route of today's Orange Line of the MBTA) opened in 1901 along with the Atlantic Avenue Elevated later in 1901. The Main Line initially used the Tremont Street subway through downtown Boston and elevated structures outside of downtown. The Main Line opened with an initial fleet of 100 wooden railroad roof open platform gate cars that had manually operated center doors, with 50 more cars being added in 1903. The railway added another 24 wooden cars of a different design with closed ends \u2013 labeled as number 2 cars \u2013 in 1904. All of Boston's wooden elevated fleet were retired and scrapped by the late 1920s, so none survive.\n\nThe year 1904 was also the year that saw the introduction of the first all-steel passenger cars with the opening of the New York City subway. One of these initial New York all-steel cars, Interborough Rapid Transit No. 3352, is now in the Seashore collection. Both because of upcoming elevated service expansion and the fact that the steel cars were safer than wooden cars in tunnels, though Boston had not suffered any underground disasters, BERy ordered its own first set of steel cars from the Pressed Steel Car Company of Pittsburgh, PA. These were number 3 cars (Nos. 0175 \u2013 0219) which arrived in 1906. (In Boston, rapid transit car numbers all started with zero to distinguish them from surface streetcars.) Comparing Boston's new steel cars with those of New York, although both of the car series shared a canvas on wood roof design, Boston's steel design was different from that of the New York cars in that Pressed Steel relied on a very strong below floor frame with a lightly built passenger compartment above it compared to the IRT design of the entire sides, from bottom sill to window sill, acting as girders that bore the weight. Boston's cars were also more modernly equipped, both with pneumatically operated doors and a fully automatic motor control. For over two decades the number 3s operated from Everett to Forest Hills on both the Atlantic Avenue Elevated and the Main Line Elevated. \n\nBERy acquired more steel elevated cars in four additional series between 1911 and 1917, bringing the roster to 170 wood cars and 157 steel cars. Replacement of the wood cars finally started in 1921 when 65 No. 8 cars were added, and about 50 wooden cars retired. Finally in 1928, 100 Nos. 9 and 10 cars were added and the remaining wood cars retired. \n\nThe oldest steel cars didn't last much longer, as ridership losses reduced the car requirements. The No. 3 and 4 cars were all in storage by 1933, and by May 1, 1935, the No. 5 cars had joined them. With the Atlantic Avenue Elevated closed, the No. 3 cars were surplus, and all but two of the cars were scrapped in 1939. BERy converted the remaining two cars, Nos. 0192 and 0210 to wrecking tool cars. This conversion included removing all the seats. No. 0210 operated along with crane car No. 0504 (which Seashore acquired in 1981). It is not clear when No. 0192 was retired, but No. 0210 soldiered on, outliving the elevated structure itself. Because No. 0210 had a wood roof, it rated indoor storage at Sullivan, Forest Hills and later Wellington carhouses. No. 0210 survived corporate reorganizations as the Metropolitan Transit Authority in 1947 and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 1964. In 1971, the MBTA painted the car in its yellow work equipment paint scheme. The MBTA used No. 0210 less after 1975. No. 0210 was the last railroad roof rapid transit car to survive in Boston. The MBTA briefly considered keeping No. 0210 as part of possible historic vehicle collection but decided to offer it to Seashore in 1994. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 0210 from the MBTA for $1. Seashore could operate No. 0210 in a train with BERy class 10 elevated cars Nos. 0997 and 01000 which had come to the museum in 1981 and 1980. Seashore intended to use these Boston elevated cars in conjunction with the former Northampton Station which Seashore brought from Boston in 1989. Indoor storage while at Boston contributed to the overall preservation of No. 0210 which remained in quite good condition at Seashore. In 1997, Seashore repainted No. 0210 to the dark green paint scheme the car had when in BERy passenger service. The interior, however, remains without seats. No. 0210 is the oldest surviving Boston elevated car. No. 0210 is the only car in the collection that shows the character of the original Boston Elevated Railway fleet, is the closest contemporary of the Boston's Tower C and Northampton Station, and remains one of the oldest all-steel passenger railway cars in the world.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green Subway car 0210", "img_src": "779-78V6Boza7zVic1zOTX9MJpJxASLYV1HadXzygA9QBcywY0fA6LSyxyaNQJhQ.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

Since the population density could not support a subway or elevated system, the city instead depended on lengthy, local transit lines, supporting various business districts along their routes. The Los Angeles Railway operated a network of 3' 6\" narrow gauge streetcar lines. In addition, the standard gauge Pacific Electric Railway operated a system of interurban lines and local Los Angeles streetcar lines. Los Angeles Railway trolleys carried a yellow paint scheme, in contrast to the red Pacific Electric cars. \n\nClimate played a role in the development of the area's transport system, where cars with both open and closed sections provided respite from sun, heat and occasional rain. The most common type of car was the California style body, with two mostly open sections on either side of a closed section. Between 1902 and 1912, the Los Angeles Railway acquired nearly 750 California cars, mostly from St. Louis Car Co. These were known as the \"Huntington Standard\" type, named for Henry Huntington who controlled the Los Angeles Railway. The \"Huntington Standard\" featured a curved corner windshield. Many early movies showed these cars. Los Angeles Railway purchased \"Huntington Standard\" No. 521 in 1906. In 1931, LARy replaced the center section longitudinal seats with walkover seats, matching walkover seats in the open sections. The railway converted No. 521 to one-man operation in 1937. Los Angeles Railway became Los Angeles Transit Lines in 1945. No. 521's final maintenance was a fresh paint job on April 27, 1950. A few months later, on September 10, 1950, No. 521 went into storage. The car had run a total of 1,334,282 miles. \n\n Los Angeles Transit Lines donated No. 521 to Seashore in 1954. Seashore transported No. 521 to Maine by ship via the Panama Canal. At the time, this was the longest equipment move by any railway museum. It was also the first time a streetcar had been delivered into the Port of Boston. Unusually, the car came with a complete record of all its modifications and maintenance. In 1993, Pacific Electric No. 680, a standard gauge streetcar that ran in Los Angeles, joined No. 521 at the museum. The structure of No. 521's narrow gauge trucks and carbody will not allow re-gauging or re-trucking the car. Thus, it is restricted to the section of track it now occupies and will not be restored to operating condition.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Los Angeles Trolley 521 historic photo", "img_src": "684-wEHynN9AlEYOvgUgfzcJEWyFcoQPG5jGRqkL99MrzjhzPk4REXxjm7SGG4jY.jpg", "img_attribution": "Bill Volkmer Collection at newdavesrailpix.com on Aug 23, 1942 at Monroe St at L.A.

A reorganization in 1911 brought a company name change. \"Line\" was dropped from the name, and the company became the Atlantic Shore Railway. When the Atlantic Shore abandoned most of its operations in the 1920s, portions continued to operate as York Utilities Co. York Utilities operated the line between Sanford, ME and Kennebunkport until 1927, and the last line between Sanford and Springvale, ME ran until 1949. Seashore's current operating route was originally part of the ASL system.\n\nIn 1906, the ASL ordered three freight locomotives (Nos. 100 \u2013 102) of wood construction from Laconia Car Co. About 1908, the ASL converted No. 101 to a box express car and enlarged No. 102, while No. 100 remained as built. Like most electric lines, the ASL's primary traffic was passengers, but the company also developed a freight business. The ASL interchanged carload freight with the Boston & Maine Railroad at Springvale, Kennebunk and West Kennebunk, ME. Beginning in 1915, the Atlantic Shore also interchanged freight with the Biddeford & Saco electric line at Biddeford. Freight included inbound shipments of coal and outbound shipments of timber products. One source of freight was cordwood harvested along the present Seashore right-of-way and hauled by No. 100 or No. 102 from the present Trolley Museum site to the Kennebunk interchange. In early years, the railroad also received coal from barges and schooners at Cape Porpoise, ME. Nos. 100 and 102 continued in service for York Utilities at Sanford until trolley freight service ended in 1949. After this, two small GE diesel locomotives hauled the freight. [See also: \"Atlantic Shore Line\" and No. 100 \"Curatorial Reports\" on Museum web site.] \n\nSeashore acquired No. 100 (along with railway post office car No. 108) when York Utilities ceased operation in 1949. Seashore had previously acquired York Utilities streetcars Nos. 82 and 88 as well as Mousam River Railroad (later York Utilities) baggage car No. 8. No. 100 received little attention at the museum until Seashore began planning a restoration in 1999. In 2006, Seashore received Federal Transportation Enhancement funds which paid for a significant part of No. 100's restoration. To comply with the restoration grants, the museum searched for and used original materials such as southern yellow pine. No. 100 arrived at Seashore painted green, but careful scraping revealed that the locomotive was brown during most of its life. Seashore also developed a related educational curriculum for elementary students, and the museum mounted a companion exhibit in its exhibit hall. Seashore completed the full restoration in 2009. In 1980, the National Park Service placed No. 100 on the National Register of Historic Place along with nine of the museum's other Maine cars.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Atlantic Shore Line Locomotive", "img_src": "625-0qdzlewOQHqFO9HXsEBxTxqwGEynvTPRLX9RbCtvC0P4qnd77G4NQU9spvTz.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

In addition, another large operator, the Connecticut Railway and Light Co., serving Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, Ansonia-Derby, New Britain and Waterbury was leased. These fourteen cities formed the basis for thirteen operating divisions, each of which maintained its own roster of cars. On August 1, 1915 a new numbering system was introduced by the Connecticut Co. which renumbered all of its cars into a single sequence. Cars from a single order or type assigned to various divisions were kept together numerically, with a few minor exceptions. For that reason, each of Seashore's Connecticut Co. cars has had two numbers. \n\nNo. 1160 (originally No. 542) was purchased by the Consolidated Railway (owned by the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad) in 1906 shortly before that company merged into the Connecticut Co., also owned by the Railroad. There was some uncertainty regarding No. 1160's builder because the builders plate was missing when the car arrived at Seashore. A Connecticut Co. roster listed Wason as the builder, and the car has Wason cast window lifts, but research by Roger Somers at Seashore in the 1990s concluded that Stephenson built No. 1160 due mostly to the specific design of the car's roof. Stephenson and Wason were both owned by J. G. Brill at this time.\n\nFrom its formation in 1907, to 1916, when steel cars were adopted, the Connecticut Company bought hundreds of closed, wooden cars, all constructed to the same basic plan. These were simple, straight-sided cars with railroad and deck roofs, manual \"armstrong\" folding doors and drop platforms. Within this basic plan there were slight differences in length, seating arrangement and electrical equipment. As with the open cars, the introduction of rollsigns spurred a change to deck roofs for the final order, though small rollsigns were applied to the vestibule ends of earlier cars such as 1160. Of these cars, 1160 is a model with longitudinal seating that provided more area for standees, 10 windows set in a 30 foot body and four motors with K-6 control. Other cars of this type had cross seating with short longitudinal seats in the body corners. Although many of these cars remained in passenger service until 1948, by 1939, No. 1160 was converted to salt service and assigned to the track department. The car exterior was repaired and repainted in work car livery in 1941. It arrived at Seashore in this livery. The trucks received very little maintenance.\n\nPrior to coming to Seashore Trolley Museum, CT Co. 1160 was stored in the upper level of James Street Car Barn in New Haven. While being stored there the track outside the barn was removed making an interesting challenge in loading the car for shipment to Maine. A ramp was constructed from wood timbers and rail from the entrance to the Barn out to the truck and trailer. No. 1160 was then unceremoniously dragged onto the truck. The reverse occurred when No. 1160 reached Seashore as there was no operational power at that time. No. 1160 did operate at Seashore during the beginning years of operation but was put into storage after its compressor failed. Other than shifting moves, No. 1160 did not move much until 1988 when restoration of the car began. Restoration continued through the 1990s and 2000s completing in 2011. Restoration involved dealing with worn out trucks, elongated bolt holes through which passed figure-eight shaped bolts, worn out bushings and bearings, and rotted wood. Much of the original components and wood still remain. Because 1160 carried salt to unfreeze turnouts as part of its track maintenance career, the steel platform knees needed to be replaced. The interior floor was replaced as it was salt soaked and would not have been healthy for the car in the long term. One side and one end have the original matchboard siding. The other side was replaced because of a large scrape incurred in passenger service on the Connecticut Co. The siding on one end was replaced because of an accident at Seashore. One crown piece was also replaced. Shortly after 1160 arrived at Seashore, tarpaper was applied to the roof totally saving the wood base. During restoration, the old canvas was removed and new canvas applied over the original wood base. The largest issue Seashore encountered was that one wheel/axle set had the wheels profiled out of round creating a severe vibration. It was necessary to pull the axle out and have it re-profiled.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Trolley 1160 Interior", "img_src": "366-TqmCnReitf9MKIEdWijE2kQGMwzBR8S9tAgakTZLmLi6b0Ci11sXfhUOdpkv.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

The cars on these lines were considered interurban cars as they ran between cities and were fitted with the proper running gear to provide for that type of service. These handsome cars also had a beautiful, ornate interior with comfortable plush seating typical of interurban type cars of that era. The cars of this series (both 5 window and 6 window versions) were lettered \"RAPID TRANSIT LINE\" by Laconia Car Co. as part of the original livery. The cars became known as \"the Rapids\" by the public.\n\nThe three Manchester street railways were subsidiaries of the Manchester Traction, Light & Power Company (later Public Service Company of New Hampshire). In 1910, No. 4 was renumbered to No. 32. In 1924, it was converted to one-man operation along with getting other modifications. The Manchester Street Railway acquired title to the car in 1932. The Manchester Street Railway's original No. 38 was wrecked in 1935, and the Manchester Street Ry., trying to deflect bad publicity, renumbered car 32 to 38 and claimed it had been repaired. The car operated as No. 38 until the company ended trolley service in 1940. The Manchester Street Ry. repainted No. 38 and the other Rapids cars in a red and white scheme to match the rest of the company's equipment and eventually removed the \"RAPID TRANSIT LINE\" logo from many of these cars.

Andrew Halliday developed a system using a steel \"rope\" under the pavement to pull the cars along and installed it on his route on Sacramento and Clay Streets in the 1870s. San Francisco's cable cars used a 3' 6\" track gauge. The California Street Cable Railroad began operation in 1878. By 1900, cable routes crisscrossed the city, but the earthquake and fire of 1906 destroyed much of the infrastructure. Several lines were too steep for electric cars and continued to use cable propulsion into the 1940s. By 1950, four through lines, and a shuttle remained, two operated by the Municipal Ry. and three by the California Street Company, which was sold to the city-owned San Francisco Municipal Ry. in 1952. A shortened version of the company's namesake line continues to operate, while the outer end of its Hyde-Jones-O'Farrell line was connected to the Washington-Jackson line to form the present Powell-Hyde line. \n\nThe Holman Car Company of San Francisco built No. 48 to replace another cable car of that number that had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Like other cars on the California Street Cable RR, No. 48 is a \"California\" type cable car with an enclosed center section, open sections on each end and provision for operation from either end. No. 48 operated on the California Street Cable Railroad's Hyde-Jones-O'Farrell line until that line was abandoned in 1954. \n\nMuseum Ownership: Canada.

TCRT decided that the various streetcar builders could not produce cars to withstand Minnesota's severe winters. So, between 1898 and 1917, Twin City Rapid Transit's own shops, using the name Transit Supply Co., built 1140 cars for its fleet, producing the nation's largest home-built trolley fleet. TCRT began acquiring new PCC cars in 1945, but older cars continued operating. In the early 1950s, the company decided to rapidly convert to buses. The last streetcar ran in 1954.\n\nTwin City Rapid Transit built No. 1267 at its Snellings Shops in St. Paul in 1907. No. 1267 is a \"gate car\" which was a prominent type of car in Minneapolis and St. Paul. It takes its name from folding wire gates instead of doors where passengers entered at the rear of the car. The company later replaced the gates with doors on most of its \"gate cars\" but not on No. 1267. No. 1267 is one of the widest cars ever built for street use, measuring 9 ft. 2 \u00bd in. across the sills. In 1928, TCRT rebuilt No. 1267 with roller bearing trucks, electric heat and a narrow passenger exit door at the front of the car in place of a high level motorman's access door. The car ran on a variety of lines. After 1946, it ran on the University of Minnesota inter-campus route. Some of the \"gate cars\" continued operating until Twin City ended streetcar service. \n\nTwin City Rapid Transit donated No. 1267 to Seashore in 1953, the day after its last run. No. 1267 was Seashore's first car acquired under the National Collection strategy. Between 1987 and 1993, Seashore completely restored the car to its 1915 appearance, including removing the front passenger exit and reinstalling the motorman's door. Museum member Doug Anderson sponsored and did much of the work on this restoration. Supporters included former President George H. W. Bush. After the restoration, Seashore used the car in regular service. Unfortunately, water penetrated the new wood siding which had to be replaced later. In 2016, Seashore restored the car's gate mechanism.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Yellow trolley 1267", "img_src": "361-VYv0H1by2KN13leGai3JcoYEIJIx7bV2wWfWIRcwJ2urhzRHKMYZeAwtueH1.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando on 05/03/19"}, {"img_alt": "Trolley 1267 entrance", "img_src": "362-rXVvHd5RWUmVlCRO5BaEV54lOEKNinVmVArsixZ5WrLCANkaphrcZoAS2o3x.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

This group of cars, often called \"Big Pullmans\" after their builder, were the largest group of streetcars to operate in Chicago. No. 225 is a \"Pay as you enter\" (PAYE) car. Although primarily built of wood, the order for these cars specified that they were to have the best of everything, regardless of weight or cost. These cars were large, heavy and very noisy. Also called \"Red Rockets\" after their Chicago Surface Lines paint scheme, these cars ran dependably though sleet and snow. Car 225 has sliding front and folding rear doors that, in its operating days in Chicago, were supposed to be opened and closed by the conductor whenever the car stopped for passengers. However, these doors were seldom shut, and full stops were made only for the lame, halt and blind. the conductor was allowed to give the proceed bell if a man had one foot on the step and his hand on the grab iron; women had to be inside the vestibule.\n\nBecause of their large carrying capacity, CSL operated the \"Big Pullmans\" on lines throughout the city where ridership was heaviest. A Cicero Life article in the Seashore curatorial files reports that one route using No. 225 was the Cermak Road line. Many riders on the Cermak line worked at the large Western Electric Hawthorne plant at the west end of the Cermak line near the border between Chicago and Cicero.\n\nChicago Surface Lines, which took over operation of all the city's street railways in 1914, was for many years the world's largest street railway with over 1000 miles of track and more than 3000 streetcars. After the Chicago surface and rapid transit lines were taken over by the publicly owned Chicago Transit Authority in 1947, the trolley cars gradually were replaced by buses and trackless trolleys. Although No. 225 and some other \"Big Pullmans\" were among Chicago's oldest cars, they were outlasted only by the CTA's fleet of PCC streamliners that were mostly built after World War II. The CTA stopped using No. 225 and other \"Big Pullmans\" for regular service in 1954 but continued using No 225 for excursions until 1957.\n\nMuseum Ownership: The largest and most enduring car class from the world's mightiest street railway was something the National Collection could ill afford to be without. When these cars became available (but not as donations), a substantial effort in times of hard money was raised to get one. The high scrap price demanded by the Chicago Transit Authority and high rail moving rates forced Seashore to choose between a Pullman and a wood open platform elevated car. While the choice is affirmed, it is regretted that we could not have had the \"L\" Car also. After a lengthy restoration at Seashore, No. 225 was outs hopped in 1999.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red 225 Trolley", "img_src": "505-jBA8SIjDZAFzliZIoojXMorEgmM34trMH4kyd3TLQ9hzZDQJp2h5ZXlVL1kC.jpg", "img_attribution": "Frederic Maloney in newdavesrailpix.com"}, {"img_alt": "Red 225 Trolley historic photo", "img_src": "506-NdhiytiSRK1CB9XVEY75U3mvO1zkLhPi4YTCgJWeR3iClfTM4s46KrFwBHoX.jpg", "img_attribution": "thetrolleydodger.com at 16th & Clark Sts.

In December of 1904, in anticipation of operating through the East Boston Tunnel then under construction, Boston Elevated Railway designed and built a pilot car \u2013 No. 5000 \u2013 at its Bartlett Street shops. The car was completed in June, 1905, and after a short test period, was approved. BERy had three separate serious of cars built based on the 5000's design:\nType 1\t\t\t\tJ.G. Brill\t\t\t5001 \u2013 5040\t\t\t1905\nType 2\t\t\t\tJ. G. Brill\t\t\t5041 \u2013 5090\t\t\t1906\nType 3\t\t\t\tSt. Louis Car Company\t5091 \u2013 5190\t\t\t1907 - 1908\nAll three groups were similar, save that Type 3 which was built by St. Louis and had 4 motors, while Type 1 and 2 had two electric motors. Type 2 had side panels sheathed in steel to give passengers the impression that the cars were less likely to be subject to fires, a major fear of riders in 1904. Types 1 and 3 had exposed wood side sheathing. \nNumber 5154 was accepted by BERy on January 25th, 1908. It was initially assigned to the Sewall Street Carhouse in Brookline. No. 5154 was converted to the prepayment system in 1914. This facilitated the conversion to one man operation around 1922, which represented a significant cost savings by eliminating the conductor. In September of 1916, it was reassigned to the Salem Street Carhouse in Medford. Then in August 1919, it started working the routes between the Sullivan Square El Station and Salem Street or West Medford via Winter Hall and Medford Square. \nBERy began retiring its Type 3s from revenue service in 1925. No. 5154 got a reprieve and was moved to the Everett Shops for conversion to a snowplow. The retired Type 3s were an excellent platform for this type of work. In 1927, BERy began converting the Type 3s into snowplows. They were especially suitable because of their heavy weight, with 4 powerful electric motors providing enough muscle to move the heavy wet snow common to the Boston area. Plows were installed on the front and back, along with wing blades to clear the snow banks away from the right-of-way. A subway type resistor was installed to permit the plow to operate at slower speeds for longer periods when clearing the snow. \nOn December 14th, 1927 the conversion was complete, and the repurposed No. 5154 returned to the Salem Street Carhouse. From there it was moved to the Arborway, then over to the Reservoir Carhouse and finally ended at Mattapan where finished its working career on the Mattapan-Ashmont High Speed line. In 1958, it was stored outside Mattapan before it was officially retired in 1974.\nSeashore Trolley Museum took ownership of No. 5154 in 1974. It was trucked from Mattapan Yard in May of 1974. Work began on the car the same year and continued until 1986. During that time, broken windows were glazed. Volunteers finished applying new canvas to the roof in 1980. Surprisingly the roof framing was in good shape with little deterioration, so none of the framing had to be replaced. The car was jacked off its trucks so that repairs to the frame could be made with the car properly aligned. Framework was completed in 1985, and No. 5154 was let down back on its trucks. Considerable work was done to the car's metal plates and structural beams. Some work was done on the plow brackets, but very little else was done to make the car operable. \nAt the end of 1986, work was suspended.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Orange snowplow 5154", "img_src": "848-EIhzYKyQG3jYyyPxFDQZpGuOjGsr3P0jy8nbq50Zh39kyo9aRQdpArhWAIzQ.jpg", "img_attribution": "Type 3 streetcar at Charlestown Neck Carhouse"}]}, "51": {"technical_information": {"control": "MK(C-97C)", "brakes": "SM", "compressor": "CP-28", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Standard", "model": "C-50"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "GE", "model": "203"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "46' 6.00\"", "width": "8' 2.00\"", "height": "11' 10.00\"", "weight": "64200 lbs."}}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 5159", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Orange snow plow 5159", "img_attribute": "Matthew D.

The AVRR connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway and provided competition to Bangor and Aroostook Railroad. The line carried many more potatoes than passengers, and barely qualified as a street railway under Maine law. The BAR had reached Presque Isle in 1894. To encourage BAR's construction, the state had granted the BAR a 30-year railroad monopoly. To protect its monopoly, the BAR sued to stop construction of the AVRR, but as a \"street railway,\" the AVRR was able to proceed. The CP acquired control of the AVRR in 1931. Despite serving an area with little population, the Aroostook Valley survived as an electric operation until 1946, and as a diesel switching line until almost 2000. No. 52, built by J.G. Brill in 1909, was designed as a combination freight locomotive, express car and snow plow. No. 52 is sometimes termed a \"box motor.\" It resembles a steam railroad baggage car in many details. With limited funds, the AVRR was able to acquire a vehicle with multiple functions. No. 52 was painted in AVRR's passenger livery of maroon, with a grey roof. No. 52 was the AVRR's only freight motive power until 1911 when the railroad purchased a steeple-cab electric locomotive. Thereafter, the AVRR used No. 52 mainly to carry less-than-carload freight and express. In later years, the AVRR used No. 52 for wire maintenance and snow plowing. It was active until the last day of electric operations in August 1946. When passenger service ended in 1946, the AVRR was the last electric interurban passenger carrier in New England.\n\nSeashore purchased AVRR No. 52, along with AVRR combine cars 70 and 71, for $350 when AVRR passenger service and electric operation quit in 1946. This was Seashore's first post-war acquisition. The three vehicles moved by freight train over the CP, Maine Central and Boston & Maine. They were stored at the Boston and Maine's Billerica Shops until Seashore was able to accommodate them. Sources show the move to Kennebunkport was sometime between 1955 and 1959. Seashore has not done restoration work on No. 52 in recent years. No. 52 ran on 1200 volts and would operate at half power on Seashore's 600 volt power.

Capital Traction's operation included routes between Capital Hill and Georgetown and Chevy Chase, MD. In 1933, Capital Traction merged with the other principal streetcar company in Washington \u2013 the Washington Railway and Electric Company \u2013 to form Capital Transit Company. Washington, like a few other cities, banned \"unsightly\" overhead wires from its streets. Washington streetcars collected power from an underground vault between the running rails. Most of the streetcars also had trolley poles for operation in the suburbs. In 1910-1912, Capital Traction purchased 150 deck roof cars, Nos. 601 \u2013 750, from the Jewett Car Co. This group included No. 611, later renumbered No. 197. These cars provided the backbone of Capital Traction's service for many years. No. 197 saw service on Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House. It is not known if No. 197 had a trolley pole for suburban operation.

In addition, another large operator, the Connecticut Railway and Light Co., serving Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, Ansonia-Derby, New Britain and Waterbury was leased. These fourteen cities formed the basis for thirteen operating divisions, each of which maintained its own roster of cars. The Connecticut Co. was owned by the New York New Haven & Hartford Railroad. In 1915, the company renumbered all of its cars into a single sequence. Cars from a single order assigned to various divisions were kept together numerically, with a few minor exceptions. For that reason, each of Seashore's Connecticut Co. cars has had two numbers. No. 1391 is one of the last batch of open cars received by the Connecticut Co. in 1910 and 1911. Built by the Osgood-Bradley Car Co. these cars featured deck roofs, with rollsigns built into the sides and ends of the monitor. The order totaled 119 cars which were distributed to 8 different divisions. The smallest allotment, two cars, went to New Britain, where they were assigned numbers 317 and 319 in the even-odd system. In 1915 they were renumbered 1391 and 1392, and were shipped to New Haven in the 1920s, where they joined the Yale Bowl fleet.\n \nLong after the Connecticut Co. withdrew open cars, such as No. 303/615, from regular service, the company used them in New Haven to shuttle football fans between the railroad station and the Yale Bowl on game days. The open cars also continued operating on excursions to the local beaches and on charter service including fan trips. The Yale service (along with the extra space to store the cars at the James Street Car Barn upper level) is, however, the reason these cars were not scrapped in the 1930s or earlier when many other systems scrapped their open cars. The last Yale Bowl open cars ran in the 1947 football season, and the last New Haven streetcar service ran on September 26, 1948. A number of these open cars were donated to museums. \nAfter retirement, No. 1391 was first donated by the Connecticut Company and preserved by the Boston Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society which wished to operate it in Boston. Clearance issues prevented this, and No. 1391 was transferred to Seashore in 1949, replacing car 1253, which had burned in a fire at the museum. Since arriving in Maine, No. 1391 has been kept in the condition it was in when it was received with occasional painting, some restoration work and running maintenance. It operated regularly until the mid 1990s, when it was sidelined due to a wheel gage problem and an issue with one bolster. The car also has a tendency to rack and twist especially when lightly loaded. This car series (termed the 1400 series) was made cheaply near the end of the manufacture of open cars so were not as solidly built as their predecessors. The design allowed the car to twist in order to absorb some of the shock from riding on the rails. That has probably worsened some over the years but is not a major issue preventing the car from operating. In 1997, No. 1391 participated in the centennial celebration of the Boston subway system and was placed on display at Boston's South Station as Boston No. 1752, the first revenue streetcar to pass through the Tremont Street subway.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Yellow Trolley 1391 scale drawing", "img_src": "541-JneqZJlJVQIQzZnJJBu0HTKAh0bwoAFhjEIwJsoIF02wCHIKyANDinD4c6t3.jpg", "img_attribution": "C.

The system was designed by Frank Sprague and began service in 1888. None of Sprague's original streetcars survived. After 1888, several companies in Richmond operated lines with single-truck trolleys. In 1910, an upstart operator, Richmond & Henrico Railway, introduced faster, double-truck cars. In 1911, Southern Car Co. of High Point, NC built four more cars for the R&H: Nos. 102, 104, 106 and 108. In 1914, R&H renumbered these cars to: 188, 190, 192 and 194. Later, Richmond's streetcar companies were consolidated as the Virginia Railway & Power Co. VR&P acquired most of its streetcars second hand. VR&P converted its cars to one-man operation in 1924. In 1925, Virginia Electric & Power Co. acquired the Richmond streetcar system as well as the systems in Norfolk, Portsmouth and Petersburg. VE&P modernized Nos. 188-194 in 1926. Streetcar service in Richmond ended in 1949. \n\nWhen VE&P retired No. 194 about 1940, the car body became the Green Light Diner, a notorious backwoods dancing and drinking establishment in Hanover, VA. After World War II, Virginia lumberman T. Edward Corker, used No. 194 as a stockroom for his truck repair facility. During the 1980s, Richmond, VA made plans to construct an historic streetcar line, but No. 194 was too large for the proposed operation. Mr. Corker donated No. 194 to Seashore in 1990. In 1994, the Valentine Museum in Richmond asked to purchase or lease No. 194. In connection with this proposal, Seashore prepared a restoration plan for the car. Seashore's trustees decided against selling No. 194, but they seriously considered a lease. Eventually, financial reverses at the Valentine ended the plan. However, as a companion plan, Seashore did loan Denver & South Platte No. 1 to the Valentine for a five year period as essentially identical Birney cars had operated in Richmond. At Seashore, No. 194 represents a car built for Richmond, the birthplace of the streetcar.

At its peak in the 1920s, there were some 750 streetcars and over 300 miles of track, including routes across the state line in Kansas City, KS. The system began as the Metropolitan Street Railway. The Metropolitan Street Railway was renamed the Kansas City Railways and then, in 1925, Kansas City Public Service. No. 922 was one of 50 cars built by the Cincinnati Car Co. in 1910-11 to replace earlier four-wheel vehicles on the Metropolitan. The car features steel sides and the so-called arch roof, in which metal ventilators replace the monitors previously used for ventilation. This was an early application of this roof style. In 1917, No. 922 was rebuilt to eliminate an unusual curved ramp leading into the car at the rear. A 1927 rebuilding provided double front doors to facilitate one man operation. In the 1940s, Kansas City Public Service applied a striking cream and black paint scheme. A former operator remembered the 900's as \"big, noisy and fast.\" No. 922's retirement date is not known, but the last Kansas City streetcars ran in 1957.\n\nAfter retirement, No. 922 (without its trucks) went to a farm in Tonganoxie, KS to be used as a home until another residence was being built. The residence was never built, and the farmer lived in the streetcar for an unknown number of years. Subsequently, the car was protected by a wooden enclosure with corrugated steel sheathing and used as a storage shed. Although it was widely believed that no traditional Kansas City streetcars had survived, Seashore discovered the body of No. 922 in 1992. The owner of the farm donated the car to Seashore.

Industrial Works (later named Industrial Brownhoist) of Bay City, Michigan built crane car No. 0551 for the Boston Elevated Railway in 1911. (In Boston, rapid transit car numbers all started with zero to distinguish them from surface streetcars.) The BERy assigned No. 0551 to the Cambridge-Dorchester subway. This subway line became part of today's MBTA Red Line. The crane car was accompanied by a tool tender trailer car such as No. 0553 which is also at Seashore. No. 0551 has a curved boom for tight tunnel clearances. It also has a special \"inching\" drive motor that can move it slowly for short distances along the track for accurate positioning. Normally, the crane car and tool car were pulled by a locomotive such as Boston Elevated No. 0514 which is also at Seashore.\n\nNo. 0551 continued in service when the Metropolitan Transit Authority took over the BERy in 1947 and when the MTA reorganized as the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 1964. By the 1970s, the crane had become obsolete. The MBTA considered removing the crane mechanism and using the remainder of the car as a flat car in work train service. Seashore became aware of this plan and instead suggested that the MBTA donate No. 0551 to the museum in exchange for a newer flat car which Seashore could give to the MBTA. In 1977, the MBTA decided to purchase a new group of flat cars for work train service and agreed to donate the crane car to Seashore without needing a flat car in exchange.\n\n In 1978, Seashore brought No. 0551 to the museum on the highway monster. The crane came in operating condition although with some mechanical problems. It was still lettered for the Boston Elevated Ry. Since No. 0551 was not self-propelled (aside from its \"inching\" motor), Seashore moved the crane with another vehicle, usually Boston rapid transit car No. 0719. Seashore also acquired two more Boston crane cars, No. 0504 in 1981 and No. 3246 in 1956. At 17 tons, No. 0551 has a higher lift capacity than the other two cranes. The museum has repainted No. 0551 and done extensive mechanical restoration work. In 1994, Seashore sent the car's traction motor to the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad's Derby, ME shop for an overhaul. This made it easier for No. 0551 to move short distances under its own power.

In 1953, it was transferred to Nagasaki as part of the rebuilding program following the atomic bomb attack. The Nagasaki Electric Tramway had begun operation in 1915, and it remains a privately-owned, profitable electric tram system. In Nagasaki, the car was numbered 134 and served until 1960. No. 134's deck roof was extended to a railroad roof using packing crate wood, probably during the Nagasaki city reconstruction.\n\nIn 1960, the Nagasaki Electric Tramway Co. donated No. 134 to Seashore. Even though the U.S. had obliterated his city 15 years before, the President of the Nagasaki Electric Tramway wrote an unusually friendly donation letter to Seashore:\n\n\"It is a pleasure for me and my company to present to you free of charge our streetcar #134.

The series became 1449 to 1477 in the great renumbering of 1915, and the first 10 cars were rebuilt to closed cars, called Converters, in the 1920s. Most of the remainder, including No. 1468, were moved to New Haven for Yale Bowl service. The Osgood-Bradley cars were noticeably weaker than the earlier cars and developed sags under the heavy Yale Bowl loads. \n \nLong after the Connecticut Co. withdrew open cars, such as No. 1468, from regular service, the company used them in New Haven to shuttle football fans between the railroad station and he Yale Bowl on game days.

The museum initially moved (under their own power) two of these cars (1468 & 838) to store them at the newly established Branford Electric Railway Association's museum before movement to Kennebunkport. The others were moved directly to Maine. Seashore also helped to move other open cars to the Connecticut Electric Railway Association in East Windsor CT.

Riders exited at the front of the car. This system was known as Pay As You Enter,\" or \"P.A.Y.E.\" Previously, the conductor would collect fares after passengers were seated. Montreal went through a series of refinements as the optimum platform layout was determined. The initial such car in 1905 had a very long platform and multiple doors which froze the conductor during the Montreal winter. No. 957 is part of a subsequent order of prepayment cars with shorter platforms and fewer doors. The ideal design is exemplified by car No. 2652 which is also at Seashore. No. 957 is one of 50 cars built by Ottawa Car Co. for the Montreal Street Railway in 1910-11. Ottawa Car Co provided the bodies, but MSR purchased other components and assembled the cars in its own shops. Montreal Street Railway assigned odd numbers from 901 to 999 to these cars. The 901 series were very early cars to be built almost entirely of steel. Industry unfamiliarity with steel resulted in a heavily overbuilt car, which at 54,010 pounds, is one of Seashore's heaviest streetcars. Another feature of No. 957 is the unique \"Montreal roof.\" This has a sloping monitor that ends midway above the vestibule rather than extending to the ends of the car. Montreal introduced this roof style in 1896 and used it until the 1913 introduction of the arch roof design. \n\nLater in 1911, after acquiring the 901 series cars, the Montreal Street Railway was consolidated into the Montreal Tramways Company. The system was taken over by the city-owned Montreal Transportation Commission in 1951. Despite its less than ideal platform and despite high power consumption due to its weight, No. 957 served for many years, before being converted into a work car in 1953. In work service, No. 957's purpose was to paint clearance lines on the street to deter motorists from parking too close to the track on narrow streets and at curves. It survived until the end of Montreal streetcar service in 1959. \n\nDuring the 1950s, Seashore members enjoyed visits to Montreal to experience an extensive, traditional streetcar system which had disappeared elsewhere in North America. When Montreal's streetcar service ended in 1959, Seashore agreed to purchase several Montreal cars, but the museum first needed to add storage capacity and to build a loop to operate Montreal's single-ended cars. The Montreal Transportation Commission agreed to store the museum's cars until Seashore was ready to receive them. No. 957 came to Seashore in 1963 along with Montreal Nos. 2052, 2652, 1176 and 1177. (Nos. 1176 and 1177 were used for parts and were not accessioned.) A year later, Seashore also enhanced its extensive Montreal collection with sightseeing car No. 2. No. 957 arrived in an advanced state of deterioration. Extensive restoration of No. 957 in the 1970s and1980s was Seashore's most expensive restoration job up to that time. The restored interior features varnished cherry woodwork, authentic rattan seat upholstery and original brass lighting fixtures. One other 901 series car, No. 997, is preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum near Montreal.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green 957 Trolley", "img_src": "537-xXz2UVnO4fCU2rNLyS9zgjaDSyo3Xt0t2TTazRYlULPmgFYy7uA1HxaKYuc4.jpg", "img_attribution": "Mstthew D.

PRT turned to the local carbuilder, J. G. Brill, and ordered 1,500 identical cars in 1911-1913 to replace most of its fleet. No. 6618 was part of this order. This is believed to be the largest single group of standardized streetcars ever acquired by any transit property anywhere in the world. These cars were dubbed \"Nearside\" cars, since they loaded at the frond door before crossing the intersection, rather than crossing to the far side and loading from the rear. The conductor sat behind the motorman, and collected fares as people entered. The cars had a small emergency door at the rear, but exiting passengers used the front door which interfered with those boarding. PRT immediately recognized the problem and responded by replacing the emergency doors with large center doors on 1,160 of the \"Nearside\" cars. In doing so, the company moved the conductor's position to just forward of the center door, making the cars conform to the Peter Witt fare collection system. In the 1930s, PRT scrapped the 340 \"Nearsides\" without center doors. PRT later converted most of the surviving cars to one-man operation. \n\nIn 1940, PRT reorganized as the Philadelphia Transportation Company. The \"Nearsides\" persisted into the 1950s, being retired only when buses replaced them. One car, No. 6618, was one of few cars not converted to one-man operation. Instead, in the early 1940s, PTC converted No. 6618 into an instruction car, where the instructor could challenge the operator with various obstacles including no air, slippery rail, and \"Oscar\", a dummy tossed in front of the car. The car included a specially-built control panel for the instructor behind the front platform. \n\nAs the \"Nearsides\" dwindled in number, the instruction car became surplus, and Seashore chose it for preservation. Philadelphia Transportation Company donated No. 6618 to Seashore in 1955. Seashore contemplated continuing to use No. 6618 as an instruction car for museum operators. Seashore rebuilt the trucks from Philadelphia's 5 ft. 2 \u00bc in. track gauge to standard gauge (4 ft. 8 1/2 in.). Seashore repainted the car and began to fix a leaky roof and sagging platform. This turned into a bigger project than was expected. Work on No. 6618 was been suspended awaiting additional funding is available. In 1975, PTC successor, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, proposed to pay for restoration of No. 6618 and to lease the car for operation as part of the national bi-centennial. However, the museum's trustees decided against sending the car to Philadelphia. No. 6618 is the only survivor of Philadelphia's \"Nearside\" cars.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green Trolley  6618", "img_src": "560-w8uX6OnjBHr7HZatBbJ9vMMMn0bppw6DeCzMBIM2laTFeD5TO2X4mYFZh4T6.jpg", "img_attribution": "Russell Monroe in Oct. 1962"}, {"img_alt": "Green Trolley 6618 historic photo", "img_src": "561-XJzffm0PcqrDZ6tE5NXx1UK5vwxzZlDO5QFoQtNMVX1mPx3N3dEr2UOmj4nR.jpg", "img_attribution": "Bill Volkmer Collection at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "66": {"technical_information": {"seats": "52", "control": "HL (15B)", "compressor": "D2-EG", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Baldwin", "model": "A"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "General Electric", "model": "216"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "46'", "width": "8' 7.00\"", "height": "12' 11.00\"", "weight": "68000 lbs."}}, "title": "Portland-Lewiston Interurban 14, Narcissus", "source": "Portland, Maine", "source_city": "Portland", "source_state": "Maine", "img_alt": "trolley with conductors", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00014IME.jpg", "builder": "Laconia Car Co.", "description": "1912 Laconia Car Co.", "secondary_use": "Summer Cottage", "category": "Interurban Cars", "year": "1912", "retired_from_service": "1933", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1969", "note": "As of 2018, the Narcissus is undergoing restoration the Town House Shop.

Six cars, including No. 14, were built prior to the line's opening and temporarily placed in storage. In addition to numbers, the cars carried names of flowers; No. 14 was named Narcissus. The cars' interiors had a regular seating section as well as a separate smoking compartment. No. 14's exterior was painted Pullman green with red trim and gold leaf lettering. The Portland-Lewiston began operating in 1914, using the tracks of the Portland Railroad to reach Monument Square in Portland and using the Lewiston Augusta & Waterville Street Railway between Auburn and Lewiston. Soon after opening, the Androscoggin Electric Company (later Central Maine Power) acquired control of the interurban. In 1914, a month after regular operation had begun, former president Theodore Roosevelt rode No. 14 between Lewiston and Portland while campaigning for the Progressive Party. Teddy Roosevelt rode the line again in 1916, but the specific car he rode then is unknown. The Narcissus continued operating until the interurban's abandonment in 1933. [See also: \"Portland-Lewiston Interurban No. 14; Maine Collection \u2013 Vehicle History\" and \"Collection Highlights; Portland-Lewiston Interurban 'Narcissus\" on the museum website.]\n\nAlmost every car from the line was used for non-transportation purposes after the line was abandoned. The body of car 14, the Narcissus, which was used as a summer cottage on Sabbatus Lake since 1933, became available and was moved to the Museum in 1969. In 1956, Seashore had obtained the bodies of two smaller Portland-Lewiston cars (No. 40 and No. 42). However these two cars were in such poor condition that they were scrapped, with parts salvaged, as No. 14 was thought to be a much better representative of the PLI. In 1988, Seashore placed the body of No. 14 on trucks that Maine State Governor John H. Reed had helped acquire from the Canadian National Railway. The trucks on Portland-Lewiston cars had included relatively unusual curved equalizer bars, and the trucks from CN's subsidiary, the Niagara, St. Catharines & Toronto Ry., came close to the original trucks' appearance. In 1995, U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie became Honorary Chairman of a committee to raise funds for the Narcissus restoration. Muskie had ridden the Portland-Lewiston Interurban in the 1930s while attending Bates College in Lewiston. Some restoration has been accomplished, and most of the equipment for this car has been set aside. In 1980, the National Park Service placed No. 14 on the National Register of Historic Places along with nine of Seashore's other Maine cars.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Trolley 14 historic photo", "img_src": "591-ggMGt5IG9hshcSBjBJEfA7LbJhLgtSFTclJCBZoKwo1iPl7ZmUsSi0ZwQ5LR.jpg", "img_attribution": "O.

The AVRR connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway and provided competition to Bangor and Aroostook Railroad. The line carried many more potatoes than passengers, and barely qualified as a street railway under Maine law. The BAR had reached Presque Isle in 1894. To encourage BAR's construction, the state had granted the BAR a 30-year railroad monopoly. To protect its monopoly, the BAR sued to stop construction of the AVRR, but, as a \"street railway,\" the AVRR was able to proceed. The CP acquired control of the AVRR in 1931. Despite serving an area with little population, the Aroostook Valley survived as an electric operation until 1946, and as a diesel switching line until almost 2000. No. 70, along with No. 71 which is also at Seashore, formed the backbone of the AVRR's passenger fleet. Wason built Nos. 70 and 71 in 1912. The cars have two compartments, one for passengers and one for baggage and express. As a combination of a coach and an express car, these are called combines. The cars were painted the Canadian Pacific's maroon color with gold leaf striping. Nos. 70 and 71 were not fast but provided a smooth ride over the relatively lightly built tracks. No. 70 made the last passenger run over the AVRR on August 7, 1946. When passenger service ended in 1946, the AVRR was the last electric interurban passenger carrier in New England.\n\nSeashore purchased Cars 70 and 71, along with AVRR box motor #52, for $350 when AVRR passenger service and electric operation quit in 1946. This was Seashore's first post-war acquisition. The three vehicles moved by freight train over the CP, Maine Central and Boston & Maine. They were stored at the Boston and Maine's Billerica Shops until Seashore was able to accommodate them. Sources show the move to Kennebunkport was sometime between 1955 and 1959. Seashore has done extensive renovation on No. 70 during the period since 1946. Car 70 is complete and operational. Nos. 70 and 71 ran on 1200 volts and operate at half speed on Seashore's 600 volt power. No. 70 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Clay County built a 51-mile line on a direct route over the hills between Kansas City and St. Joseph, MO \u2013 a route impossible for the steam railroads which had to follow a longer route in the Missouri River valley between these cities. A ride on the interurban took two hours, compared with three on the steam railroads. The interuban's cars often reached 70 mph. The KCCC&StJ also operated a 28-mile line east from Kansas City to Excelsior Springs, MO. The KCCC&StJ Ry. was a subsidiary of the Kansas City, Clay County & St. Joseph Corporation set up in Maine as a holding company for the interurban and the St. Joseph Electric Ry. Because of the distances involved, the KCCC&StJ used 1500 volts to reduce the need for substations. The Depression and bus competition led to the line's abandonment in 1933. \n\nNo. 24 is one of 16 steel cars built by the Cincinnati Car Co. for the interurban's opening. The KCCC&StJ's cars had center entrance doors and no other doors. This was rare in interurban practice. The door arrangement eliminated the possibility of converting to one man operation, which may have contributed to the line's demise in 1933. Running through wide open territory, cork insulation was used on this car to insulate the body from sound, heat and cold. Cars were painted maroon with green trim.

Birney to design a low cost, standardized car. This design, combining attributes of both high floor deck roof cars, and the later steel lightweights, became known as the Stone & Webster Standard Car and enjoyed widespread use on the company's rails. Since many of these systems were marginal operations, the cars were discarded as buses took over in the 1920s and 1930s. Several years after designing the Standard Car, Mr. Birney designed the single truck safety car which is known as the \"Birney Car.\" \n\nStone & Webster acquired control of the Dallas Consolidated Electric Street Railway in 1902. After acquiring other Dallas streetcar companies in 1917, the merged companies became the Dallas Railway Co. In 1926, the name changed again to Dallas Railway & Terminal Co. The Dallas system purchased about 100 of the Standard Cars. No. 434 was a Standard Car built by American Car Co. for Dallas Consolidated in 1914. The city of Dallas, TX was the last one to operate the Standard Cars. Except for later PCC cars, the Dallas paint scheme was green and white. Small brackets over each row of seats, held signs lettered \"For White\" on one side and \"For Colored\" on the other, since the car operated in a \"Jim Crow\" city. The signs could be moved to accommodate traffic as needed.\n\nMuseum Ownership: In 1954, Dallas Railway & Terminal donated No. 434 to Seashore. Thanks to Dallas' dry, warm climate, No. 434 came to Seashore in good condition and has not required major body repairs. Repairs to the roof, doors and sash have kept this car looking good over the years it has been at Seashore. In 2016, the museum did another overhaul. In recent years, a Dallas organization, the McKinney Av. Transportation Authority (actually a museum operation) acquired and restored the body of a similar car. Seashore keeps the \"White\" and \"Colored\" signs under a seat but uses them to explain the car's history.\n\nDuring the acquisition of No. 434, Seashore developed a good relationship with DR&T Vice President L.W. Lunt. This led to donations of various streetcar parts as DR&T abandoned its last streetcars in 1956.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green 434 Trolley", "img_src": "713-cqpcf53gla89UxLLH01S2m2eLIRbEDdz2CPDwX34hHK8QaihQ0ChiRIhvdx8.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

In 1914, BERy needed power to haul its work trains on its elevated lines. Since there were no manufacturers of this type of locomotive because of the very limited market, the railway had to design and build the locomotive at their Bartlett Street Shops. The frame was fabricated from scrap rail, which was also used as ballast to improve the locomotive's traction. 0514 was assigned to the Everett-Forest Hills elevated line hauling work trains. \n\nIn the late 1940's, elevated lines (Els) started to fall out of favor with the public who preferred subways. The overhead El structures were noisy and an ugly eyesore. They darkened the streets below them and seemed to divide their cities. Beginning in the mid-1930's, the Boston Elevated began dismantling the Orange Line El which was then known as the Main Line El. The Atlantic Avenue branch was taken out of service without replacement during the Great Depression, then dismantled during World War II to help the war efforts. The Charlestown El was taken out of service in 1957 followed by the Roxbury El in 1987. Both were replaced by surface or subway alignments up to a quarter mile away. \n\nThe dismantling of the elevated lines made 0514 redundant. It was stored in 1974 and finally put totally out of service in 1976. \n\nNo. 0514 operated for three successive Boston transit systems \u2013 Boston Elevated 1914-1947, then the Metropolitan Transit Authority 1947-1976, and finally ending its long career with the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority. \n\nThe locomotive was acquired by the museum in 1976.

Kuhlman for the Cleveland Railway Company in 1914-15. This class of cars eventually grew to 201 cars. These cars were designed by Cleveland Transit Commissioner, Peter Witt, and featured center doors. Passengers entered at the right center door and exited from the left center, paying when they passed the conductor who sat between the two doors. The design also included at high-domed roof with Scullin ventilator louvers. Cleveland designed these cars to haul a trailer car. Cleveland was unique in its extensive use of motor-trailer streetcar trains. At 51 feet, No. 1227 is the longest city streetcar in the Seashore collection. The center-entrance cars operated on most of Cleveland's trunk routes, often hauling trailer cars. After purchasing these center-entrance cars, Cleveland purchased very similar cars also designed by Peter Witt, where the center door was for exiting and a front door was for passenger entrance. This \"Peter Witt\" style car became popular in Cleveland and elsewhere. In 1942, the city of Cleveland bought the Cleveland Railway, forming the Cleveland Transit System. Cleveland scrapped most of its center-entrance cars in 1947-48, but No. 1227 had previously been sold to the Cleveland Interurban Railroad. \n\nThe brothers, O.P. and M.J. Van Sweringen had developed the suburb of Shaker Heights, OH and built the Cleveland Interurban Railroad to provide trolley service between Terminal Tower in downtown Cleveland and the suburb. In 1925, the Cleveland Interuban leased several Cleveland Ry. center-entrance cars including No. 1227. During the depression, the Cleveland Interuban returned No. 1227 and some other center-entrance cars to the Cleveland Ry. No. 1227 went into storage until 1940, when the Cleveland Interurban purchased 36 Cleveland Ry. center-entrance cars, including No. 1227. The Cleveland Interurban renumbered most of these cars by dropping the \"12\" prefix from the Cleveland numbers. It converted these cars to multiple-unit operation and removed the Scullin ventilator louvers. Cleveland Interurban also changed the trucks from Cleveland Standard (Brill 67F) to Brill 177E trucks more suitable to the interurban service. In 1944, the city of Shaker Heights purchased the Cleveland Interurban, renaming it the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit. Newer PCC cars replaced the center-door cars on the Shaker Heights line by about 1960. [See also: \"the Museum's Cleveland Collection,\" Dispatch, March 2010, and Dispatch, May 2015, p. 14 and \"A Trolley with Nine Lives\" on museum website]\n\nIn 1959, No. 1227 went to the Baltimore Streetcar Museum's site in Baltimore. Because the car did not fit with the wide gauge Baltimore collection, in 1968 No. 1227 went to the Trolley Valhalla museum in Tansboro, NJ and later Jobstown, NJ. No. 1227's car frame was badly damaged in the move to Tansboro. Ronald Jedlicka, a trolley preservationist in Ohio eventually acquired the car. In 1984, Jedlicka donated No. 1227, less trucks and some components, to Seashore. Seashore removed the MU equipment and installed Brill 177E trucks. Work stretching over 30 years culminated in the full restoration of No. 1227 to its 1920s Cleveland Ry. appearance. Seashore dedicated the car on Members Day, September 12, 2015. In 2009, Seashore acquired matching Cleveland trailer car No. 2365 which will create a train typical of historic Cleveland operation.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Yellow 1227 Trolley Left side", "img_src": "462-OEepc0eEWi2ow6FmHLDsVqDPq5GrqtTrfDxovXRmCEHvIgVSastgulSBbbeI.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

No. 4175 was one of a class of 50 cars delivered from Laconia Car to the Bay State Street Ry. in late 1913 and early 1914. No. 4175 initially ran on a route from Scollay Square, Boston to the Beachmont section of Revere, MA. In 1917, the car moved to Newport, RI., operating between Newport, RI and Fall River, MA. No. 4175 was one of several of the Bay State's semi-convertible cars included when the Newport Street Railway took over operations. Its exact car number in this period is unknown. Trolley service in Newport ended in 1926, and the semi-convertibles were sold to the Coast Cities Ry. Co. of New Jersey, where they ran for a few more years.

This design became known as a \"Peter Witt\" car. Cleveland Railway ordered 130 of these cars from G.C. Kuhlman Car Co. and 75 from Cincinnati Car Co. Before all the Cincinnati Car Co. streetcars were delivered, Cleveland Railway decided the design was less than satisfactory and took delivery of only 25 cars from Cincinnati. So, Cincinnati Car sold the remaining 50 \"Peter Witt\" cars, including No. 1213, to New York State Railways Rochester Division in 1916. These cars were among the first to use innovative construction techniques to allow lighter weight metal components. \n\nNew York State Railways owned four interurban railroads as well as several local streetcar operations in the state. The company had acquired the Rochester system in 1909. New York State Railways was itself owned by the New York Central Railroad. New York State Railways later converted No. 1213 to one-man operation by installing a turnstile by the front door and covering one of the center doors. In 1927, New York State Railways began operating in a new subway tunnel which the city of Rochester constructed in the former canal bed of the Erie Canal. Trolleys, including No. 1213, operating in this subway earned the nickname \"Submarines.\" In 1938, Rochester Transit Corporation took over operation of the streetcar and bus system in Rochester. Streetcar operation ended in 1941 except for a line in the subway which continued until 1956. \n\nAfter most streetcar service ended in Rochester in 1941, former Rochester Police Chief Henry Copenhagen moved the body of No. 1213 to his country home in Webster, NY. where he used it as a cottage. It sat directly on the ground and had a steel subfloor. Henry Copenhagen's nephew, Alan Copenhagen, donated No. 1213 to Seashore in 1985. No. 1213 was one of the first vehicles that Seashore acquired from secondary uses rather than directly from a transit company. Seashore took a new approach to restoration of this car. The museum built a completely new frame and floor and then joined this to the rest of the body. This approach was necessary because the design did not allow piecemeal component replacement. No. 1213 was later joined by two other Rochester trolleys at Seashore: New York State Railways No. 394 and Rochester & Sodus Bay No. 113. Seashore also owns two other cars similar to No. 1213. These are Cleveland Railways Nos. 1227 and 2365 which were also designed by Peter Witt but which have a design where passengers both enter and leave by the center door.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Rochester NY trolley 1213", "img_src": "642-k1MASE7q3WfAtN2RKib22gMR5WKZDNBejxAOUYOoutmeJFkvQyfCl6RJbzSU.jpg", "img_attribution": "Donald G.

Industrial Works was established in 1873, and became the world's leading manufacturer of large lifting cranes. For a long time, it was the only manufacturer of large lifting cranes in the United States. In 1931, it merged with Brown Hoisting Company of Cleveland, Ohio, becoming the Industrial Brownhoist Corporation. In 1960, it was sold to the American Hoist Corporation of Minneapolis, and became known as the Industrial Brownhoist Division of the American Hoist Corporation. The plant at Bay City was closed for good in 1983, ending 110 years of manufacturing at that location. \n\nElectric cranes, as opposed to the steam cranes prevalent at the time, were ideal because they were immediately ready for work, not having to wait to fire up and make steam. Also, the service of a fireman was not needed. No. 3246 was equipped with a trolley pole for work on surface lines, but no collector shoes on the trucks which would have allowed it to work on the elevated lines. It had a master controller for the four Westinghouse 306V traction motors and one for the hoist motor. Accessories for the crane, outside of the regular hook, included a snow bucket, a wheel bucket, a magnet and a pavement smasher, although none of these accessories came with the vehicle to the museum. The crane's capacity is up for discussion, but from all data, it was between 5- and 10-tons. No. 3246 was one of three such cranes owned by BERy, and was used for general track and construction work, as well as snow removal. \n\nNumber 3246 was delivered to BERy's George Street Yard in Charlestown on August 4th, 1916, and moved to Eliot Square on August 7th, 1916, to be equipped and tested. It was turned over to the maintenance department at the Albany Street Shops on September 28th, 1916. The crane spent its last 24 years at the Charlestown Neck Carhouse, where it was retired in 1954. During its career, it worked on the following notable projects:\n\n1.)\tThe Great Molasses Flood of 1919 when 2.3 million gallons of molasses were released from a burst storage tank, which sent waves of molasses as high as 15 feet rushing through the streets at speeds estimated at 35 mph. Steel panels from the tank were driven against BERy's Atlantic Avenue structure and caused damage to the El in the area north of Battery Street. \n2.)\tThe Beach Street Elevated Wreck of July 22, 1928 occurred when a four-car elevated train crashed on a sharp curve at Beach Street and Harrison Avenue killing two people and injuring several others. The train was going at an estimated speed of 40 mph, some attributed to brake failure. All four cars were derailed. \n3.)\tKenmore Square Subway Extension.\n4.)\tHuntington Avenue Subway.\n5.)\tDorchester Trolley Bus Extension.\n6.)\tOrient Heights Rapid Transit Extension. \n\nThe original paint scheme for the crane was:\nRoof and Dashers \u2013 Green.\nCar Body \u2013 Black.\nCab Roof \u2013 Gray.\nEnd Anti-Climbers \u2013 White. \nIn 1940, the green paint scheme was replaced with orange, with black lettering. \n \nNumber 3246 was retired in 1954, and sold to Seashore Trolley Museum the same year. \n\nMuseum Ownership: No. 3246 was purchased from the Metropolitan Transit Authority mid-summer of 1954. It was trucked to STM either in 1954 or February, 1955 . The car was taken to the end of the Fellsway Line at Elm Street. It was jacked up using BERy screw jacks and carefully lifted off its truck and lowered onto the Seashore's Highway Monster. The crane then lifted up its own trucks and placed them on a smaller trailer for the trip to Maine.\n\nIt quickly became \"the car that built Seashore\", and was immediately put to work distributing rail for the museum's connection between its existing main line and the abandoned Atlantic Shore Line right-of-way. It was also used in the construction of the Riverside and Central Car Barns, setting RS & E (Rochester, Syracuse and Eastern Railroad) catenary towers to support the trolley wire for the new main line extension and occasionally lifting cars for removing/replacing trucks and rerail derailments. In order to set the car barn rafters and trusses in place, an 8 foot boom extension, which could be flipped over, was constructed and added to the end of the boom. \n\nThe car's maintenance records reflect its hard use while at STM. Air and electrical issues plagued No. 3246. As late as 2008, maintenance work continued with the replacement of the boom cables, but the crane had one motor out of service and the H-L control group needing to be overhauled.

A dispute with the local telephone company regarding return electric currents in the track caused CSR to use an unusual dual overhead trolley wire system. Another unusual feature of the Cincinnati system was its 5 ft. 2 \u00bd in. track gauge. At its maximum, CSR operated 222 miles of track. CSR also owned a large car building operation which became a separate firm \u2013 Cincinnati Car Company. CSR purchased most of its cars from Cincinnati Car until the builder closed in the 1930s. Streetcar operation ended in 1951. In 2016, Cincinnati opened a modern streetcar line named the Cincinnati Bell Connector.\n\nCSR acquired almost 600 large wooden cars between 1905 and 1919, including 100 cars of the 2100 series in 1917. No. 2105 is typical of this fleet. The car spent most of its operating life on the Vine & Clifton Route 55. CSR converted some of its fleet to one-man operation, but No. 2105 remained a two-man car.

Kuhlman and the Cleveland Railway shop 1917-18. These cars were designed by Cleveland Transit Commissioner, Peter Witt, and featured center doors. Passengers entered at the right center door and exited from the left center, paying when they passed the assistant conductor who sat between the two doors. Cleveland designed these cars to be hauled by a center entrance car in the 1100-1300 series, such as No. 1227 which is also at Seashore. The center-entrance cars operated on most of Cleveland's trunk routes, often hauling trailer cars. Cleveland had the largest fleet of trailers on the North American continent. Trailer cars were an inexpensive way for streetcar operators to add capacity that would be used for only a few peak period hours each day. Cleveland's trailers had continuous longitudinal seats for maximum standing room. These cars were crowded and uncomfortable. In 1942, the city of Cleveland bought the Cleveland Railway, forming the Cleveland Transit System. Cleveland scrapped most of its center-entrance cars in 1947-48, but, in 1947, the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit purchased three Cleveland trailer cars including No. 2365. \n\nThe brothers, O.P. and M.J. Van Sweringen had developed the suburb of Shaker Heights, OH and built the Cleveland Interurban Railroad to provide trolley service between Terminal Tower in downtown Cleveland and the suburb. In the 1920s, the Cleveland Interuban leased and later purchased 36 Cleveland center-entrance cars in the 1100-1300 series. In 1944, the city of Shaker Heights purchased the Cleveland Interurban, renaming it the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit. After acquiring No. 2365 in 1947, Shaker Heights renumbered it to No. 58. No. 58 and the other two trailers ran for Shaker Heights only one year. An uphill run to Shaker Square was too much for their power cars. SHRT then used No. 58 as a crew locker room for the next 17 years. \nAfter being its use as a crew locker room, the Gerald E. Brookins Museum of Electric Railways (known as Trolleyville, USA) in Olmsted Township, OH acquired No. 2365. The Brookins Museum closed in 2005. Another group, the Lake Shore Electric Railway Museum, took over the Trolleyville collection and attempted to restart a museum. This museum plan failed. The Lake Shore Electric Ry. Museum auctioned off its collection in 2009 when Seashore acquired No. 2365. In 1987, Seashore had received, by donation, Cleveland center-entrance trailer No. 2318. This car was one of the other trailers also operated by Shaker Heights Rapid Transit. No. 2365 was in better condition than No. 2318. Not needing two trailer cars, Seashore donated No. 2318 to the Northern Ohio Railway Museum in Seville, OH in 2010. No. 2365 is believed to be one of only four trailers preserved at North American museums. No. 2365 is in fairly good condition and requires mostly cosmetic repairs. The car is on Brill 67F trucks which is the type used on Cleveland No. 1227 when it was originally built. Seashore has a set of trucks of the type used on Cleveland trailer cars, but these trailer trucks are relatively small and might be unsafe on the museum's trackage.

The company reorganized as Baltimore Transit Co. in 1935. The BTC converted most of its lines to buses between 1948 and 1956. Its last streetcar ran in 1963. \n\nNo. 5748, built in 1917, was one of 885 Brill semi-convertible cars acquired by United Railways & Electric between 1905 and 1919. These were the dominant car class in Baltimore for most of the streetcar era. Brill's semi-convertible design featured two-sash windows which could slide on runners into the roof during the summer. Baltimore's last 140 semi-convertibles had longer bodies with 13 windows on each side instead of 11 windows on the earlier cars. An estimated 60% of all patrons who ever rode a Baltimore streetcar up to their 1963 abandonment did so on a Brill semi-convertible. One of the later groups of Baltimore's semi-convertibles was the 80 cars that UR&E ordered from Brill in 1917 and place in service the following year. UR&E numbered these Nos. 1501-1570 and 1951-1960 because they were to run on routes 15 and 19. In 1922, UR&E renumbered these to Nos. 5745-5824. No. 1504 became No. 5748. In 1937, Baltimore Transit Co. converted No. 5748 to one-man operation. When BTC converted cars to one-man operation, the company repainted the cars from red to a bright yellow paint scheme. No. 5748 was modified with steel siding in its later years. BTC retired most of its Brill semi-convertibles by 1950. No. 5748 and a few others continued to run on the suburban Ellicott City route until service on this line ended in 1955.\n\nThe Maryland Historical Society and local railfans saved No. 5748 from scrapping. The Baltimore group was unable to find a site for No. 5748 in Baltimore and presented it, without trucks, to Seashore in 1957. Seashore obtained a set of standard gauge 27G trucks from Montreal to use on No. 5748. No. 5748 joins United Railways & Electric No. 6144, a Peter Witt car which Seashore had acquired in 1955.

The100 cars in the 4200 series were equipped with K-controllers for city operation, while the 4300 series had automatic acceleration for the longer runs through the suburbs. These were fast cars and popular with the riding public, warm in the winter and cool in the summer. No. 4387 initially operated between Sullivan Square, Boston and Lowell, MA via Reading, MA. When Bay State Street Ry. reorganized in 1919 as the Eastern Massachusetts Street Ry, No. 4387 became part of the new company. Eastern Massachusetts Street Ry. operated trolley lines north and south of Boston and connected with the Boston Elevated Railway at several points. As the system contracted in the 1930s, the 4200s and 4300s were not sold off until 49 were sold to the Boston Elevated concurrent with its acquisition of the Chelsea - Revere Division lines in 1936. A few 4200s in Quincy, and 10 4300s in Stoneham survived into the 1940s. Some locals called these trolleys the \"yellow peril.\" In 1946, No. 4387 was the last car to run on the line between Sullivan Square Station, Charlestown, MA to Stoneham, MA. NEERHS trustee Lester Stephenson, Sr. operated the car on its last run and helped negotiate the museum's purchase of the car.

Lake Shore Electric operated through cars between Cleveland and Detroit, MI using the Detroit Monroe & Toledo Short Line (later, Eastern Michigan \u2013 Toledo Railroad) beyond Toledo. No. 171 is one of 12 \"Big Steel\" cars built by Jewett Car Company in 1918 shortly before Jewett's demise in 1919. At 61 feet long, these Jewett cars were among the longest interurban coaches. In 1932, the Lake Shore's traffic was hurt by the abandonment of its connection to Detroit. No. 171 turned over in a spectacular accident, but was repaired and returned to service only a few months before Lake Shore Electric ended passenger service in May 1938. The Lake Shore Electric was Cleveland's last interurban railway.\n\nLake Shore's Jewett cars were the system's flagship cars. No. 171 is a prime example of large steel interurbans purchased by larger systems to replace or supplement early 1900s wood cars. Later, smaller fast and nimble streamlined, lightweight cars with low operating costs like Seashore's CRANDIC No. 118, Lehigh Valley Transit No. 1030 and Philadelphia & Western No. 208 would operate on the few systems purchasing new cars.\n\nAfter 1938, many Lake Shore Electric cars found uses as residences and sheds throughout northern Ohio. No. 171 became a diner at Monroeville, OH. Lake Shore Electric has scrapped No. 171's wheels, brake, motor and control equipment as well as most interior fittings.\n\nOne of the longest interurban cars in our collection fulfilled a dream of Seashore founder and long-time president Ted Santarelli. Ted had traveled in Ohio during the 1930s, and found this system connecting Toledo and Cleveland inspiring. In 1987, the body of number 171 turned up at the estate sale of the diner's owner, and Ted eagerly sponsored its acquisition by Seashore. Some preliminary work was done to stabilize the car, but Ted passed away before he could initiate a full restoration program. Fundraising for the car in Ted Santarelli's memory amounts to nearly $40,000.

In 1923, the company reorganized as the Key System Transit Co. It took its new name from the shape of its route map. The streetcar division was renamed East Bay Street Railways in 1930 and then East Bay Transit Co. in 1936. Key's lines connected with ferries to reach San Francisco. After the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge opened in 1939, Key's interurbans ran across the bridge into San Francisco. In 1946, National City Lines acquired control of Key System streetcars and interurbans. In 1948, Key converted the Oakland streetcar lines to buses. The interurban lines converted to buses in 1958. The Key System also provided rail freight service, a portion of which survives as the Oakland Terminal Railway. \n\nNo. 804 was built with a deck roof. Key modified the roof to the arch design in 1930 along with converting the car to one-man operation. \n\nWhen local streetcar service in Oakland ended in 1948, the Key System sold No. 804 to W.

The Oshawa Ry. operated partly on city streets and carried both passengers and freight. The line became a Grand Trunk subsidiary in 1912.

Although passenger service ended in 1940, No. 300 and other OR locomotives continued to haul freight, with a General Motors plant being the largest customer. After 1959, the railway began abandoning its street trackage. On May 11, 1963, large crowds watched No. 300 pull the last freight train on King Street before the abandonment of that track. In 1964, the Canadian National absorbed the Oshawa Railway and converted the remaining operation to diesel operation. \n\nSeashore purchased No. 300 from the Canadian National Railways for U.S. $1,300 when the Oshawa Ry. dieselized in 1964. Two other museums also acquired Oshawa electric locomotives. No. 300 came to Seashore by rail on its own wheels via CN and Boston & Maine Railroad. Ben Minnich termed No. 300 \"Seashore's best pulling locomotive.\"", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green 300 Locomotive", "img_src": "633-Y9Fw2GJuIkVcqctIABrjcCl3rjqGqsCM3b2ukFANonkU5mhiCCIWUacFi6v1.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

St. Ry. ordered twelve snow sweepers from the Russell Plow Company to be delivered prior to the 1919-1920 snow season, but only three made the schedule, including our P-601, which went into service at Taunton, MA, on January 31st, 1920. Eventually, all the sweepers arrived, numbered P-600 through P-611. The standard trucks for the twelve sweepers were Brill 27E 1 & 1/2, but for some reason P-600 and P-601 came with Bay State 12 trucks. P-601 received its Brill trucks when the Eastern Mass. began scrapping its early 1300 series cars. The snow sweeper had large rotary sweepers (brushes) at either end of the car so that it was bi-directional. The brush at the \"front\" direction of travel would drop down to sweep the snow off between the rails. Each brush had its own GE67 motor and K-Controller. The sweeper was also equipped with wing blades to clear the snow off to the sides along the right-of-way. \n\nIn July of 1932, buses replaced streetcars around Taunton, making P-601 redundant. It was transferred to the Brockton Division for a time, and then to the Quincy Division. In the spring of 1935, it was moved to the Lynn Division where it became one of six sweepers sold to New York City's Third Avenue Railway System (TARS). The six sweepers were gathered at the General Electric Lynn plant and shipped. Eventually eleven of the original twelve sweepers were sold to TARS, with P-603 the only one of the group to remain in the Boston area, being sold to the Boston Elevated Railway as part of Boston Elevated acquisition of the Chelsea Division in 1936.\n\nThe sweepers that were bought by TARS became numbers 85 through 95, with P-601 becoming 86. TARS served the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx and lower Westchester County. Number 86 (No. P-601) was dispatched to the Bronx. The Eastern Mass sweeper never worked in Manhattan, since the line featured conduit with a slot in the middle for pick up, rather than overhead wire. New York City's Board of Transportation had for years been applying pressure to the streetcar companies to use buses. Beginning in 1928, TARS began converting to buses, and by 1948 all streetcar service ceased in Manhattan and the Bronx. Once again, the sweeper became redundant. \n\nOn December 12th, 1944, the City of Toronto, Canada experienced a very severe snow storm that brought most of their streetcar system to a standstill. TTC realized that their existing fleet of single-truck sweepers were not up to the task, and something bigger and more powerful was needed. TTC purchased twelve sweepers from TARS, all but one of which originally came from the Eastern Mass. This single car came from the Trenton & Mercer County Traction Co. in New Jersey. Four sweepers were shipped in 1947, and eight other, including No. 86, were shipped 1948. TARS No. 86 (P-601) became Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) No. S-31 and was regauged to Toronto's 4' 10 7/8\". The sweeper was painted TTC \"old\" dark red with TTC standard cream roof. The sweepers' future looked secure until 1970, when TTC reached an agreement with the City of Toronto to transfer all streetcar line snow removal to the city. TTC immediately began phasing out snow removal along its street right-of-way. \n\nIn 1973, TTC announced that the sweepers were surplus and were available for purchase. Seashore Trolley Museum began to explore the possibility of securing one of the surplus sweepers. STM member Kevin T. Farrell began discussions with the Ontario Electrical Railway Historical Society, which was brokering the sale of the equipment for TTC. STM purchased S-31 based upon the maintenance records provided by the Society and conversations Kevin had with TTC employees. Kevin then coordinated and raised the funds necessary to have the car shipped by rail to Kennebunk, ME. \n \n\nP-601 arrived in the Kennebunk rail yard on November 2nd, 1973. It was reloaded onto a flat bed and delivered to STM the following day. \n\nIn November of 1974, its wide gauge Brill trucks were replaced with Standard C50P trucks from Boston bottom-dump No. 3618. The bottom-dump eventually ended up at the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum, where it is still operating. \n\n1975 saw the roof rehabilitated, with some roof boards replaced and new canvas being applied. Letterboards and trolley boards were also replaced. This work was sponsored largely by one of the Seashore Trolley Museum founders, John Amlaw. \n\nIn 1977 Number S-31 joined the select group of STM equipment to be temporarily returned to the MBTA to help cover specific equipment shortages. Ex-Claremont Line car No 4 made a trip to Boston in 1969 and again in 1975. Bottom-dump No. 3617 went in the 80's, and snow plow No. 5106 in 1996, On January 12th, 1977, the MBTA contacted STM looking for snow removal equipment. Two days later MBTA officials arrived to look at S-31, but the inspection almost killed the deal \u2013 S-31 was frozen to the rails in South Boston Barn, and the brooms wouldn't turn due to frozen lube oil craters in the gear boxes. All major issues were resolved, and S-31 was loaded onto a truck on January 21 for a road trip to the MBTA's Mattapan Yard. It was assigned to work the Mattapan-Ashmont High Speed Line. The line's only plow was out of service, and the last storm had closed the line down since the only piece of equipment to clear the line was a Pettibone speed swing. S-31 promptly made a clearance run over the line, reportedly with a sizable crew of Seashore Trolley Museum MBTA members. \n\nS-31 had to wait until February 20th to be put to use. After that, it only went out two more times before winter finally ended. In mid-March, a special fan trip was organized with about 20 STM members making several runs on the High Speed Line between Mattapan and Cedar Grove. This was done on a Sunday while the line was closed while work was being done on the Ashmont Station. The Mattapan-Ashmont Line was then shut down for a major summer rehab project, and S-31 was trucked back to STM. MBTA wanted to keep it longer, but the museum had concern about the security of the car. \n\nVolunteer workers continued to work on the car as private funding became available. . In early 1981, it was decided to restore the sweeper to its original Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway P-601 appearance. On May 23, 1981, P-601 was officially outshopped, painted and lettered in Eastern Mass. style. The car had received all new sheathing and the four sliding doors had been reglued, reglazed, stripped and primed. Rotted wood framing was replaced. The roof had all new canvas. Various pieces of external hardware were either relocated or removed to give the car its original Eastern appearance. The brooms were disassembled and recaned. Two coats of \"pencil\" yellow Eastern Mass. paint were applied. One set of the Brill trucks was torn down, and the two wheel sets sent to the BAR to have them regauged. But once it was found that the Standard C50P trucks worked well, it was decided move on to other priorities. \n\nIn 1982, in preparation for the February 14 \"Winter on Trolley Line\", it was found that broom #2 had gear box issues, leaving only #1 broom operational for the demonstration. Parts were eventually secured in New Jersey from the owner of one of P-601's sisters. This \"sister\" was originally Trenton No. 31 that went to TARS (No. 82), then TTC (S-39). It ended up going to New Jersey Transit (No.5246) to work on their city subway trolley line in Newark, New Jersey. \n\nWork was completed at the end of 1982, and P-601 was ready to go for 1983.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Yellow snow sweeper trolley", "img_src": "842-XdWeJcbBceUklJkk9A5EvQhc9HBySpAYvt8XjgzxIDU8eP1wrCIXlFWquZwT.jpg", "img_attribution": "Russell Monroe in 1981"}, {"img_alt": "Yellow snow sweeper trolley", "img_src": "843-gthbWz04gMijIdvhV8sSGHxVibHNkfUwuWQtgyvVmrSZbbrBBdbq70FIwczq.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando on 03/17/20"}, {"img_alt": "Yellow snow sweeper trolley historic photo", "img_src": "844-akX70BOiT79dU5aVOrjeTd3vSJXBkcKhXgDqmqsHejqoIzD74qBa3cwHcYMt.jpg", "img_attribution": "In Quincy MA on 02/07-1935 \u2013 STM Curatorial File"}]}, "106": {"technical_information": {"seats": "55", "control": "K-35G", "brakes": "SME", "compressor": "DH-16", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "TM", "model": "M35AB"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "508A"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "45'", "width": "8' 6.00\"", "height": "12'", "weight": "35000 lbs."}}, "title": "Milwaukee & Suburban Transport Corp. 861", "source": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "source_city": "Milwaukee", "source_state": "Wisconsin", "img_alt": "Orange Trolley 861", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00861SWI.jpg", "builder": "St. Louis Car Co.", "description": "1920 St. Louis Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1920", "retired_from_service": "1958", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1958", "note": "861 is stored in Fairview Car Barn", "fund": "760", "sponsormanager": "None", "car_id": "106", "history": "The Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co. (known as the Transport Company, or abbreviated as TM) operated more than 800 cars on over 400 miles of track, making it one of the larger systems in the Midwest. TM's system included local lines in Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha as well as interurban lines radiating from Milwaukee. In 1938, the TM formed a subsidiary, the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Transport, for its streetcar operations. The system rapidly converted to bus in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1952, the remaining streetcar lines were sold to the Milwaukee & Suburban Transport Corp. Trolley service ended in 1958. Milwaukee is building a modern streetcar line scheduled to begin service in 2018.\n\n1920, TM acquired 100 streetcars numbered in the 800 series. St. Louis car built the car bodies while Milwaukee Electric built the trucks in its own shops. These cars were designed for either one-man or two-man operation and used lightweight materials. This reduced operating costs, enabling shorter headways. However, snow would hinder operation of the 800s while heavier cars could keep running. The car body was part steel, part wood. The trucks saved weight by using chrome vanadium steel. The 800s showed the company's distinctive car design, marked by a narrow center end window, flanked by two wider ones. In 1926, TM converted No. 861 to straight one-man operation, removing the extra doors needed for two-man operation and repainting the car from yellow to orange with green trim. The Milwaukee & Suburban Transport Company saved No. 861 for Seashore at the time of final streetcar abandonment in 1958.\n\n No. 861 came to Seashore in fairly good condition, but many years of operation over rough track had weakened the roof structure, causing the body to bulge at the letterboards. In the 1980s, Seashore did substantial restoration work on the car. This restoration included installing a new canvas roof, replacing most of the air piping and re-upholstering many of the seats. Despite this effort, the car has seen limited service due to electrical failures. Extensive work failed to correct this problem. No. 861 has an unusual cartridge fuse system \u2013 one for each of the four motors. The car's relatively high seating capacity (55) would make it desirable for Seashore's operating fleet.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Orange Trolley 861", "img_src": "514-MafCHL7OVl9xK7atVra9agJeGTzy63rpDUjSxCUWRBUVdN9WAURu72h05sxR.jpg", "img_attribution": "Russell Monroe in Oct. 1962"}, {"img_alt": "Orange Trolley 861 historic photo", "img_src": "718-RG0ehlstqhqSdhmn1SIC52ggwTMRyOA4aa7rmhqSwftxk2ci7nzA5CKFLRZk.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister Car 868 in Milwaukee \u2013 Frank Pfuhler Collection at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "107": {"technical_information": {"seats": "32", "control": "K-63BR", "trucks": {"number": "1", "manufacturer": "Brill", "model": "79E"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "General Electric", "model": "506"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "28'", "width": "7' 8.00\"", "height": "9' 10.00\"", "weight": "15980 lbs."}}, "title": "Portland Railroad Co. 615", "source": "Portland, Maine", "source_city": "Portland", "source_state": "Maine", "img_alt": "Birney 615", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "652-B7puCqxvPsuLB1krbxRRciLXGUI4DWrqofGoAhqwshwwD5plzq1na56wF7fV.jpg", "builder": "Wason Manufacturing Co.", "description": "1920 Wason Manufacturing Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1920", "retired_from_service": "1941", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1941", "fund": "819", "car_id": "107", "history": "The Birney car was designed by Charles O. Birney of the Stone & Webster engineering staff for use on the many street railway properties owned by that firm. It was also licensed to numerous carbuilders for general sales. The Birney car had a relatively small seating capacity (30-32 passengers) and was designed for one man operation. With only a single, light-weight, two axle truck, the Birney cars had a tendency to gallop on anything but the smoothest track. Some 6000 Birney cars were built from ca. 1916 - 1930, and the cars operated in many cities across the U.S., Canada and overseas. Their economical operation extended the street railway era in numerous cities. \n\nA key feature of the Birney cars that allowed one-man operation was the \"deadman\" safety device. The operator needed to keep constant downward pressure on the controller handle or the car would go into emergency braking. So, the Birney cars were also called \"Safety Cars.\"\n\nNo. 615 is one of eight Birney cars built by Wason for the Portland Railroad in 1920. They followed 15 other Birney cars from Wason a year previously. The Portland Railroad operated 200 cars and over 100 miles of track extending between Saco, ME on the south and Yarmouth, ME on the north. Portland's last trolleys ran in 1941. The Portland Railroad sold No. 615 to the Biddeford & Saco Railroad in 1936. All but two of Portland's 23 Birney cars were sold to the Biddeford & Saco in 1936 and 1937 and were so numerous compared to the previous equipment, that they were run until they broke down, and then stored in favor of a working car. No attempt was made to renumber them into the Biddeford & Saco system of odd for open and even for closed. No. 615 operated on the B&S between Biddeford and Old Orchard Beach until B&S ended trolley operation in 1939. The scrapper dismantling the cars and buildings of the Biddeford & Saco used the body of Car 615 as an office for the duration of the work and subsequently sold it to Seashore in 1940. \n\nNo. 615 was used as the museum's first bunkhouse and later served as the office. Seashore then placed No. 615 in storage. No. 615 lost its original two-axle truck in 1939. No. 615 is the only surviving Portland trolley.

The N6-V trams were designed to haul one or two unmotorized trailers. The trams had speedometers which were unusual for streetcars. In 1943, allied bombing shut down parts of Hamburg's tram network. No. 2705 survived World War II although 13 other N6-V trams were badly damaged or destroyed. Following the war, Hamburg revived its tram system. In 1947, Hamburg renumbered the surviving trams, and No. 2705 became No. 2539. Hamburg extensively modernized the N6-V trams in 1957-58. Originally double end cars, these trams were changed to one way operation with door openings on the right side only. The N6-V class became class Z2u, and No. 2539 was renumbered again, becoming No. 2710. Hamburg gradually replaced its tram system with buses and with S-Bahn and U-Bahn rapid transit lines. The last surface tram ran in 1978. \n\nAs a result of the efforts of Karl-Robert Leimbach, a German exchange student who had visited the museum, Hamburger Hochbahn donated No. 2710 to Seashore in 1965. The German General Consul and Vice Consul in Boston assisted in the project. Additional help came from the United States Lines which carried No. 2710 free of charge to Boston on the S.S. Pioneer Glen. A special luncheon for dignitaries and representatives of the press was held at Boston's Sheraton-Plaza Hotel. With cooperation of the Federation of German Agricultural Exporters and two barbershop quartet groups, the car was displayed at Greater Boston supermarkets and in two parades before moving to Kennebunkport. Seashore quickly began using No. 2710 in passenger service. Later, in 1973, Seashore acquired another German tram, Berlin No. 3412. Seashore recently did some interior restoration work on No. 2710.

The interurban came under the control of the Canadian National Railway when the Grand Trunk became part of CNR in 1923. Single end cars were the rule, coupled back to back in trains using a minimum of 2 cars. The M&SC usually headed a train with a freight motor car to carry milk, farm produce and other freight. Ottawa Car Co. built No. 610 in 1922. It is a classic interurban with wooden sash and a coal stove to provide heat.

This design became known as a \"Peter Witt\" car and became popular in Cleveland and elsewhere. The Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) took over the Toronto Railway Company in 1921 and undertook a major fleet renewal. The new fleet consisted of 350 \"Peter Witt\" motor cars and 225 matching trailers. There were two varieties, \"Large Witts\" able to haul trailers, and \"Small Witts\" which were lighter and one window shorter. In 1938, the TTC started buying PCC streetcars to replace older Toronto Railways equipment, but most of the \"Peter Witt\" cars continued running until a major streetcar line was replaced with the Yonge Street subway in 1954. Some \"Peter Witts\" remained in regular service until 1963. As late as the 1980s, there were one large and two smalls plying Toronto's streets as \"Tour Trams.\" In 1954, the Toronto Transportation Commission was renamed the Toronto Transit Commission. By the 1960s, most U.S. and Canadian cities had abandoned their streetcar systems, leaving Toronto the largest streetcar operator in North America.\n\nAs part of the TTC's fleet renewal, in 1923 Ottawa Car Co. built 50 \"Small Witt\" cars with even numbers from 2800 to 2898. (The TTC assigned even numbers to motor cars and odd numbers to trailer cars.) TTC converted No. 2890 to one-man operation in 1936. The TTC retired No. 2890 from regular service in 1960. The TTC overhauled the car and ran it in charter service until 1963.\n\nWhen TTC was retiring its pre-PCC streetcars in the 1960s, Seashore had acquired several Montreal cars and decided not to seek a Toronto car. However, in 1969, Seashore had acquired a Canadian interurban car, Lake Erie & Northern No. 797, from the failed Rail City Museum. No. 797 sat untouched at Seashore for decades. In the meantime, the Ontario Electric Railway Association, operating as the Halton County Radial Railway, had acquired several Toronto \"Peter Witt\" cars, including No. 2890 donated by TTC in 1963. The Halton County Radial Railway offered to trade their TTC \"Small Witt\" No. 2890 for Seashore's No. 797. Seashore desired the Toronto car because Toronto was the most significant North American streetcar system not yet represented in the museum's collection. The two museums made the exchange in 1999. The Halton museum had done substantial restoration on No. 2890, and the car came to Seashore in fair condition. Seashore regauged the trucks from Toronto gauge (4' 10-3/4\") to standard. No. 2890 joined two other \"Peter Witt\" cars at Seashore: New York State Railways No. 1213 and Baltimore No. 6144. Several other Toronto \"Peter Witt\" cars are preserved at Canadian museums and at the Shore Line Trolley Museum in Connecticut.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red trolley rear end", "img_src": "394-a7BvcIeoCJGmc41gWaQiSjdetP3UdQbKSCK84lmPqVjhkEXNjJNUAB31peS7.jpg", "img_attribution": "Derek Carter on 09/13/19"}, {"img_alt": "Red trolley controls", "img_src": "395-Jh6luWcG23Q9tuTl1REEAc4ldkCKuyhDBo17uIXmSuvrx2EYW3LoRGL4xyWs.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

To handle growing traffic, the BERy converted the tunnel to rapid transit operation in 1924. The Pullman Car Company built a fleet of new cars for the line. Forty cars were delivered in 1923 (Nos. 0500 \u2013 0539, termed No. 1 cars) followed by 8 more in 1924 (Nos. 0540 \u2013 0547, termed No. 2 cars). (All Boston rapid transit cars have a \"0\" in front of their numbers to distinguish them from streetcars.) The cars for the new line were similar to the center-entrance streetcars they replaced, using the same control and motors, with Taylor trucks for a better ride. The car bodies were smaller copies of the Cambridge Tunnel cars with three doors per side for faster loading and unloading. Each car had controls at only one end, and the blind ends were linked by drawbars without couplers. To save space in the relatively small cars, one car in the pair carried electrical equipment and the other car carried the air brake equipment. They were the first married pair rapid transit cars in the U. S. Because of the tight clearances in the former streetcar tunnel, these cars were among the smallest rapid transit cars in the United States. \n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority took over operation of the BERy in 1947. Starting in 1951, the MTA equipped the East Boston cars with pantographs and roof headlights for use on the new Revere Extension. The cars retained third rail shoes for operation in the tunnel. Motors and control were upgraded, and brighter lighting was installed. The MTA painted the East Boston cars two-tone gray with an orange stripe instead of the prior dark green. The MTA extended the line to Wonderland in 1954, using the former Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad right-of-way. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority acquired the MTA in 1964. The MBTA adopted a color coding scheme to identify Boston's various transit lines; the line to Wonderland became the Blue Line. So, a second repaint job for the East Boston cars took place in 1972, when blue and white replaced the former gray. At this time, robin's egg blue replaced the pea green in the interior, and the seats were painted dark blue. Finally, in 1979, new cars, known as \"Bluebells,\" began to replace the venerable No. 1 and No. 2 East Boston cars. The MBTA kept most of the old cars for eight more years as potential work cars. \n \n\nIn 1987, a pair of No. 1 cars, Nos. 0512 and 0513, and a pair of No. 2 cars, Nos. 0546 and 0547, came to Seashore. Nos. 0512 and 0513 were equipped with trolley poles and refurbished in the late 1980s. The pair served as the \"Terror Train\" during several of the museum's \"Ghost Trolley\" events. A reported brake problem took this train out of service in the mid-1990s.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Boston Blue Line train historic photo", "img_src": "784-KZeYQCk9Zg30KqXXLdo3CKNTReJZsyBmmkFDCVTeLkkNrwovWWx0KRy2lJve.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister car 528 in Boston in Aug 1966 \u2013 Jerry Appleman at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "118": {"technical_information": {}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 1484", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Pump car", "img_attribute": "Francis Cheney Collection", "img_src": "870-aNrUd3T1MKCAoWJesHSeyqSH9Ud7LvKzOpqc9UMcDEgCmeZcI7gf2M5nUrHN.jpg", "builder": "Boston Elevated Ry.", "description": "1924 Boston Elevated Ry.", "category": "Railway Work Equipment", "year": "1924", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1990", "car_id": "118", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Pump car", "img_src": "871-JNXdBTKoeB9YYOPaLKaiNUJ2tXzymyAb7kIiSheuQbs0E7o8uiaCDSI4VPH6.jpg", "img_attribution": "At Watertown - \tFrancis Cheney Collection"}], "history": ""}, "119": {"technical_information": {"seats": "44", "control": "K-35GG", "brakes": "SM-3", "compressor": "DH-16", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Standard", "model": "C-35P"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "508A"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "42' 6.00\"", "width": "8' 7.00\"", "height": "10' 8.00\"", "weight": "28952 lbs."}}, "title": "Wheeling Traction Co. 639", "source": "Wheeling, West Virginia", "source_city": "Wheeling", "source_state": "West Virginia", "img_alt": "Orange Trolley", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00639SWV.jpg", "builder": "Cincinnati Car Co.", "description": "1924 Cincinnati Car Co.", "secondary_use": "Doctor's office", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1924", "retired_from_service": "1948", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1957", "fund": "876", "sponsormanager": "Jim Schantz", "car_id": "119", "history": "Wheeling Traction, a subsidiary of West Penn Railways, operated a streetcar and interurban system serving the Wheeling, WV area, including Bridgeport and Martins Ferry which were in Ohio, across the Ohio River from Wheeling. Part of the Wheeling Traction system was 5' 2 \u00bd\" gauge and part was standard gauge. Wheeling was unusual in having competing streetcar companies than never consolidated. Wheeling's smaller company was West Virginia Traction and Electric Co. (later, Wheeling Public Service). WVT&E also owned a system in Morgantown, WV which is represented at Seashore by car No. 115, acquired in 2002.\n\nCincinnati Car Co. built 21 cars, Nos. 631-651, for Wheeling Traction in 1924. These cars had Cincinnati's distinctive curved-side design which became standard on many streetcar systems in the Midwest and South. The standard version of the curved side car, such as No. 639, was so widely used that they became known as \"rubber stamp\" trolleys. Cincinnati Car Co. designed these cars in the 1920s as a light-weight, power saving model \u2013 a forerunner of later streamlined cars. Curved steel plates formed the car sides. Instead of the floor, the side plates and side sills bore most of the weight load. Longitudinal floor supports were no longer needed which made the cars lighter than conventional cars. Cincinnati curved-side cars made up an important part of Wheeling's fleet. The cars carried West Penn's orange paint scheme and triangle symbol. Nos. 631-651 came with rattan seats. In 1933, employees, in an effort to save their jobs, banded together to buy the property from West Penn. The new organization, Co-operative Transit Company, became a 52-mile, 66 car system. Half the mileage was in Ohio and half in West Virginia. CTC dropped the leading 6 in the curved-side numbers so No. 639 became No. 39. CTC began conversion to buses in 1935 and ran its last streetcar in 1948.\n\n\n\nWhen the system quit in 1948, a doctor in Little Hocking, OH purchased the carbody of No. 39 for use as a medical dispensary. After the doctor died in 1957, Seashore acquired the car from his daughter, Majel Amerine. No. 39's condition had deteriorated, but Seashore sought the car because no other museum preserved a \"rubber stamp\" curved-side car and because it was such an important car design. \n\nCo-operative Transit employees, particularly William Gwinn, who had worked on the Wheeling streetcars helped provide Seashore with details and photos needed to restore the car. Restoration began in 1974 and was substantially completed in 2009. Standard C35P trucks from a Boston Type 5 car were acquired for the car as they were very similar to the original C-40P trucks (differing principally by having a 6 inch shorter wheelbase). Cane walkover seats came from Chicago 4000 series \"L\" cars. The car, numbered 39 when Co-operative Transit acquired the system, was returned to its earlier number during restoration. Because of rotted and rusted components, the museum had to replace much of No. 639's structure. This became one of the most extensive restoration programs in Seashore's history. The result thus became more of a replica than a restoration. No. 639 is one of only two surviving operational Cincinnati curved-side trolleys and the only one of the widely-used \"rubber stamp\" style.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Orange Trolley", "img_src": "352-gYHE1Ab8OFJjFwADf3PcOxUEc3Wq5xjUoy6MIvmyVJGgO4DDv9FiTWsXIdWg.jpg", "img_attribution": "Katie Orlando"}, {"img_alt": "Historical photo of 639 in Wheeling", "img_src": "353-Zkz7uA3mMvCcmMnz1R3vwzA8inDlDrLVY2tStFRfwNdeL8chlhCn9BIQqiJx.jpg", "img_attribution": "Jim Shantz Collection"}]}, "120": {"technical_information": {"seats": "28", "engine": "Dodge"}, "title": "Wayland, Mass.

The school bus is the oldest bus in our collection, being built in 1924 by the Graham Brothers Truck Company headquartered in Evansville, Indiana. The three Graham brothers began their career in the truck business in 1916, building truck body kits to modify Model T's and TT's bodies into trucks. In 1919 they formed the Graham Brothers Truck Company and began producing the \"Truck Builder\", latter known as \"Glider Kits\". The \"Truck Builder\" was a complete vehicle, save the engine and transmission. The rear axle was a torbensen internal-gear truck axle manufactured by the Easton Axle Company. Initially, the trucks were built using engines produced by such companies as Continental, Weideley and Dodge. But the brothers quickly realized that the most reliable engine/transmission combination came from Dodge. Obviously, they couldn't go directly to Dodge, since it already manufactured its own line of small trucks, so they began buying engines/transmissions from Dixie Motor Company, the local Evansville Dodge dealer. Dodge began to wonder why Dixie was ordering so many motors and transmissions and realized that Graham Brothers became second only to General Motors in truck production, engines and transmissions carrying the Dodge label. In 1921, Graham and Dodge came to an agreement whereby Graham would build their trucks, and they would be sold through the Dodge dealer network. In 1924, Dodge bought control of Graham Brothers in exchange for stock, with the brothers continuing with production. But Dodge began moving the operation to Detroit, and in 1927, the brothers sold their remaining interests in the business to Dodge. \n\nThe bus was operated by a Mr. Showham for the Wayland, Massachusetts, public school system. When it was retired, it was stored in the owner's barn in Natick, MA. \n\nSeashore Trolley Museum member Tom Ford discovered the bus in 1975 outside at its Natick home. The grandson of the owner had taken it out of the barn to work on it, but lost interest, so it had been sitting in the elements for some time. Dr. Ford convinced the owner to donate it to the museum.

From the Birney car it inherited lightweight design, a low floor, and a high horsepower to weight ratio. Boston Elevated purchased 471 of the Type 5 cars between 1922 and 1928. After examining their experience with the first groups of Type 5s, the Elevated instituted a small design change in 1924. This was actually a response to increasing Boston traffic, more than to a fault in the original Type 5 design. Wood was eliminated from the window posts at the operator's position and brass sash replaced the wood ones. This reduced the number of blind spots and allowed the operator a better view of cars approaching from the side. It was hoped that this could reduce accidents and improve the Elevated's already stellar safety record.

In 1897, the Boston Elevated also took over streetcar lines in Boston. In the 1920s, impressed with the cost savings afforded by the Birney car, but recognizing that it did not meet the needs of its routes, the Boston Elevated designed a double truck, lightweight car, similar to its earlier semi-convertibles, which met its needs.

No. 5734 continued in service after 1947 when the Metropolitan Transit Authority took over Boston Elevated's operation. After 1951, the MTA had a fleet of 321 single ended PCC cars which handled most of the streetcar service, but the MTA needed a few Type 5 cars to operate routes needing double ended cars. No. 5734 was among nine Type 5 cars remaining in operation until 1959. In 1958, the MTA bought eight double ended PCC cars from Dallas to replace the remaining Type 5s.\n \nIn 1959, Seashore acquired No. 5734. In 1954, Seashore had acquired Boston Elevated No. 5821 which is another Type 5 car very similar to No. 5734 but with a \"vision front,\" featuring narrower end posts and window frames to reduce obstructions to the motorman's line of sight. When No. 5734 came to Seashore, the car ran in regular service and was later put in storage. In the 1960s, the museum repainted the car. To help mark the 20th anniversary of Boston's Riverside streetcar line in 1979, Seashore leased No. 5734 to the MBTA (successor to the MTA) for $1 per year. No. 5734 was refurbished by Seashore before moving to the MBTA's Watertown carhouse. The lease provided for the Boston Street Railway Association to use No. 5734 on charter trips over the Green Line. During the 1980s, the BSRA used the car on various trips, and Seashore volunteers continued refurbishment at the Watertown carhouse. When conversion of the overhead wire on the Green line was complete, making operation of the trolley-pole equipped 5734 problematic, the MBTA moved No. 5734 to display at the Boylston station and subsequently disconnected the track on which the car sits from the rest of the Green Line.

Brill in 1922-25 for New Orleans Public Service. Perley Thomas, located in High Point, NC, built cars for many southern systems. It is the only traditional U.S. streetcar builder still in business, now renamed Thomas Built Buses and building school buses. New Orleans Public Service, Inc. was formed in 1922 to acquire the bankrupt New Orleans Railway & Light Co. as well as other gas and electric utilities in New Orleans. In 1925, NOPSI began converting streetcar lines to bus operation. No. 966 was assigned to the Canal Street line when it was converted to buses in 1964. No. 966 became surplus. This left only one New Orleans streetcar line in operation: St. Charles Avenue. The St. Charles Avenue line continues to operate using the traditional 900 series streetcars. The St. Charles line began operating in 1835 making it the oldest continuing operating streetcar line in the world (except for a period of reconstruction after 2005's Hurricane Katrina). The St. Charles line first used steam locomotives and then horse cars before converting to electric power in 1893. A Streetcar Named Desire, the play by Tennessee Williams, made New Orleans streetcars famous. The title of the play refers to a streetcar line on Rue Desire which used cars similar to No. 966 although this car probably did not operate on the Desire line. To comply with segregation laws, New Orleans streetcars had signs to fit on a seat back dividing the car between white and \"colored\" seating. [See also: \"An Afternoon with Elmer\" on museum web site.] \n\nIn 1964, NOPSI donated No. 966 to the Heart of Dixie Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. NOPSI also donated cars to six other museums. That year, NOPSI offered to donate a streetcar to Seashore, but the museum was fully occupied with other acquisitions and had to decline the New Orleans offer. In 1982, the NRHS group decided that No. 966 did not fit with their collection and donated it to Seashore. Though essentially complete and sound, car 966 required extensive cosmetic and mechanical work to bring it back to first class condition. It also needed to be regauged from 5' 2-1/2\" to standard gauge. In 1984, the Regional Transit Authority, which had taken over NOPSI's transit operations, offered to purchase No. 966 from Seashore and place it back in operation on the St. Charles line, but Seashore turned down this offer. \n\nWhen Seashore got the opportunity to provide a car to augment the National Park Service's Lowell, MA trolley operation, 966, a high capacity car that is easy and economical to run, was chosen for the assignment. Unlike Seashore, which has to deal with numerous wheel profiles, the Lowell operation standardized on a standard freight profile requiring deep flanges and wide treads. Seashore had a set of matching trucks with the correct motors and wheels, so the museum swapped them for the ones under No. 966. No. 966's original trucks will be used to equip Bay State Street Railway No. 4175, for which the proper trucks do not exist. Meanwhile, car 966 serves as our ambassador in a city where trolleys like No. 4175 once ran.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green 966 Trolley", "img_src": "356-iAuEIw50MDAivIZ6sNBkh1k81B50u0xNw9BmEli4MVkOgI4qjSniM1JHicWf.jpg", "img_attribution": "Roger Summers on 08/15/2009"}, {"img_alt": "966 Trolley Interior", "img_src": "357-6iSnHShE6MTPAzJhxOgpBRiL094TzNHYJe1jya98Do450cK2bFmtDgDWlP3v.jpg", "img_attribution": "Fred Maloney at newdavesrailpix.com"}, {"img_alt": "966 Trolley Historical Photo", "img_src": "358-SfAkDr4DowsiAodcqLSaHMRnvRwm2MTJs1St3l35Vad7aIT2hnc6vXXLbTmE.jpg", "img_attribution": "R.

To handle growing traffic, the BERy converted the tunnel to rapid transit operation in 1924. The Pullman Car Company built a fleet of new cars for the line. Forty cars were delivered in 1923 (Nos. 0500 \u2013 0539, termed No. 1 cars) followed by 8 more in 1924 (Nos. 0540 \u2013 0547, termed No. 2 cars). (All Boston rapid transit cars have a \"0\" in front of their numbers to distinguish them from streetcars.) The cars for the new line were similar to the center-entrance streetcars they replaced, using the same control and motors, with Taylor trucks for a better ride. The carbodies were smaller copies of the Cambridge Tunnel cars with three doors per side for faster loading and unloading. Each car had controls at only one end, and the blind ends were linked by drawbars without couplers. To save space in the relatively small cars, one car in the pair carried electrical equipment and the other car carried the air brake equipment. They were the first married pair rapid transit cars in the U. S. Because of the tight clearances in the former streetcar tunnel, these cars were among the smallest rapid transit cars in the United States. \n\nThe Metropolitan Transit Authority took over operation of the BERy in 1947. Starting in 1951, the MTA equipped the East Boston cars with pantographs and roof headlights for use on the new Revere Extension. The cars retained third rail shoes for operation in the tunnel. Motors and control were upgraded, and brighter lighting was installed. The MTA painted the East Boston cars two-tone gray with an orange stripe instead of the prior dark green. The MTA extended the line to Wonderland in 1954, using the former Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad right-of-way. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority acquired the MTA in 1964. The MBTA adopted a color coding scheme to identify Boston's various transit lines; the line to Wonderland became the Blue Line. So, a second repaint job for the East Boston cars took place in 1972, when blue and white replaced the former gray. At this time, robin's egg blue replaced the pea green in the interior, and the seats were painted dark blue. Finally, in 1979, new cars, known as \"Bluebells,\" began to replace the venerable No. 1 and No. 2 East Boston cars. The MBTA kept most of the old cars for eight more years as potential work cars. \n\n In 1987, a pair of No. 1 cars, Nos. 0512 and 0513, and a pair of No. 2 cars, Nos. 0546 and 0547, came to Seashore.

Pacific Electric operated city services in several cities, including Los Angeles. The most legendary of PE's street services was that on Hollywood Boulevard, known during the heyday of the movie capital as \"The Boulevard of the Red Cars.\" No. 680 is one of 160 similar cars built for operation on Hollywood Boulevard and other city and suburban lines. These Hollywood cars were low and heavy, with cement floors but otherwise all steel. Initially they were rather slow, though fast acceleration and wide, quick loading center doors made good schedules possible. When No. 680 entered service in 1924, Hollywood Blvd. cars ran on a 2 minute headway in rush hours and on 3 minute headways in base service. The PE expanded operation of the 600 class cars to other lines in the system. In 1939, Pacific Electric modernized these cars, raising top speed from 28 mph to 45 mph and improving seating, lighting and fenders. PE also applied the famous butterfly paint scheme, with orange and silver wings offsetting the Pacific Electric's traditional red. These cars carried heavy ridership during World War II. In 1949, PE converted No. 680 to one man operation and renumbered the car to No. 5069.\n \nOther Pacific Electric cars operated true interurban service, reaching neighboring cities along private rights-of-way. The entire Pacific Electric system was standard gauge, so its cars did not mingle with the narrow gauge city cars with the exception of a few locations in Los Angeles. \n\nIn 1953, PE sold No. 5069 (ex-680) to the Portland Traction Company for service on the Oregon City and Bellrose suburban lines, where the number became 4022\n\nAfter Portland Traction's service ended in 1958, the car was saved for museum purposes. For a period, the car sat on a street in downtown Hillsborough, OR, and the motors and electrical controls were sold to raise funds. After several unsuccessful projects, private collector Eugene Stoller purchased No. 680. Mr. Stoller took the car to his property in Woodburn, OR, and sold it to Seashore in 1992. The trip to Maine in 1993 on a contractor's rig was among Seashore's longest road moves.

Blackpool is the only British city to maintain tram service continually from the early days to the present. Blackpool Corporation built No. 144 in 1925 in its own workshops. No. 144 is one of 33 similar cars built by Blackpool between 1923 and 1927. These were termed Blackpool \"standard\" cars. The upper deck is covered but has open ends. The car is typical of British double deck cars used from the early 1900s until the 1950s. This car has a swivel shoe on its pole, allowing for automatic reversing at the terminals. Electrical equipment was constructed by the British Thomson-Houston Co., an affiliate of the General Electric Company of the U. S. Blackpool operated several tram lines, but the principal route ran 11 miles from Blackpool to Fleetwood along the Blackpool Promenade. In the 1950s, Blackpool replaced many older cars with more modern steel, Art Deco-styled double deck streetcars. The last standard car in regular service ran in 1966. As of 2018, the main route along the Promenade is in operation using modern trams. Older \"heritage\" trams also run on weekends. \n\nThe Mayor and Aldermen of Blackpool gave No. 144 to Seashore in 1954. No. 144 was Seashore's first foreign car acquisition. During 1957-1959, Seashore replaced the roof and painted the car in its original red and cream paint scheme. Extensive rewiring and rehabilitation took place during the period from 2000 to 2015. The museum also repainted No. 144 in the green and cream paint scheme that it wore during most of its operating life. During the restoration, Seashore used extensive advice from the National Tramway Museum in Crich, England. No. 144 operated at Seashore in earlier years. However, the museum's trolley wire has sagged somewhat since then, and No. 144 is now too high to operate under portions of Seashore's trolley wire.

The last Knoxville streetcars ran in 1947. \n\nCincinnati Car Co. designed its distinctive curved-side cars in the 1920s as a light-weight, power saving model \u2013 a forerunner of later streamlined cars. A reverse curve in the lower side panel gave the cars greater structural strength. Instead of the floor, the side plates and side sills bore most of the weight load. Longitudinal floor supports were no longer needed which made the cars lighter than conventional cars. Aluminum castings where applicable further reduced weight. Most of Cincinnati Car's curved-side streetcars were double truck cars, but Knoxville Power & Light acquired a fleet of single truck curved-sides from Cincinnati Car. Knoxville's last group of these trolleys was 16 single truck curved-side cars acquired in 1925, Nos. 408 - 423. These cars had the Knoxville feature of a mailbox on the side of the car so that one could post a letter on a passing streetcar.

At 69th St. the P&WCT connected with the Philadelphia Rapid Transit's elevated line to center city Philadelphia. In 1936, the company renamed itself as Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Co. In 1948, the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Co. (also known as \"Red Arrow Lines\") acquired control of the Philadelphia & Western Railway. The P&W operated an interurban line out of the same 69th Street terminal to Norristown, PA. In 1970, the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, a state agency, acquired the PSTC. The West Chester and Ardmore lines were abandoned, but the Sharon Hill and Media lines remain in operation with modern light rail vehicles.\n\nThe Red Arrow Lines acquired 32 steel, center entrance cars in three batches from Brill between 1919 and 1926. These cars replaced older wooden cars. The second batch, Nos. 55-64, came in 1925. The center entrance cars had wide doors permitting passengers to enter at the same time as others were leaving the car. This provided rapid loading and unloading. The center entrance cars had couplers and often operated as two-car trains. While not known for speed, the center entrance cars were ideal for handling peak loads. The center door cars were mostly retired after 1960, but a few continued in school service. In 1969, Merritt Taylor, Jr., who ran the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Co., had center door car 62 restored to its original P&WCT appearance. In 1970, Taylor agreed to donate No. 62 to Seashore. \n\nSeashore brought No. 62 to Maine in 1971. In order to convert No. 62 from 5' 2 \u00bd\" gauge to standard gauge, Seashore arranged for the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad to make new axles at the railroad's Derby, ME shops. At the same time, the 5' 4 \u00bd\" wheel and axle sets from Baltimore Peter Witt No. 6144 were also regauged. The larger axles from No. 62 were machined down to become the new axles for No. 6144. Used diesel locomotive axles were machined for No. 62. No. 62 began operating at the museum in 1972.

Meadowbank build No. 1700 about 1925 (sources differ on the exact date.) Meadowbank, based in Sydney, was a producer of agricultural machinery as well as trams. The P-Class trams operated on most of Sydney's lines. One route served Sydney's famous Bondi Beach which generated immense demands for the city's transportation system. To handle the crowds, the P-Class trams had 8 compartments, each seating 10 on wooden cross benches. There was no center aisle; each compartment was accessed only from running boards on the outside. Each compartment had folding canvass doors. The dangerous design required the conductor to walk along the outside running boards to collect fares. In rainy weather, conductors wore heavy oilskin raincoats. The conductors' union unsuccessfully campaigned to eliminate the footboard trams. To simplify operations the cars were operated in two car trains. General Electric, of Schenectady, NY, supplied the multiple unit equipment. This long distance order was made because representatives from Sydney had inspected the Bay State Street Railway's 4300 class cars, and were impressed with the control system. Thus, these very unusual Australian cars have a very American feel to operators. Some other unique aspects of the cars include almost flat roofs surrounded by a raised ornamental parapet, tight cabs, and narrow running boards. From the 1930s, many P-Class trams, including No. 1700, carried large, illuminated advertising panels mounted on the roof line. Sydney retired the last P-Class trams in 1960; all tram service ended in 1961. In 1997, Sydney opened a modern, light rail system.\nIn 1961, Seashore president Theodore (Ted) Santarelli de Brasch sponsored the purchase of No. 1700 for 100 Australian pounds. No. 1700 was shipped to the U. S. that year and has required occasional painting and roof repairs but no heavy repair work. Seashore and its cousin, the Sydney Tramway Museum, have worked together to obtain and share needed parts for this car and two sister cars \"down under.\" Seashore has operated No. 1700 in passenger service at various times, but the car's relatively tiny wheel flanges limits the car's use. Because Sydney was Australia's largest city and because the capital, Canberra, never had streetcars, Seashore historian Ben Minnich thought No. 1700 partially qualified for the museum's Great World Capitals collection.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Australian trolley interior", "img_src": "490-FTQrG4IV73wyQIA5wzcGwDn1hY3GnB1RCDWNhqhNkkFoDeYziuadn4Nomq5l.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

In 1934, the OER modernized their cars, replacing the wooden seats with Heyward-Wakefield bus seats, converting all cars to one-man operation and changing the paint scheme from green to red and cream.

This car was one of a fleet of 55 double-truck, lightweight cars and 50 matching single-truck cars that provided most of the streetcar service in Fort Wayne, IN. These were well-designed and well-equipped lightweight cars custom-designed for a prosperous smaller city system. Indiana Service also operated interurban lines in the Fort Wayne region which were transferred to the Indiana Railroad in 1930. In 1940, Indiana Service began converting its streetcar operation to trackless trolley and bus operation. Streetcar service in Fort Wayne ended in 1947. Around the end of World War II, Atlantic City Transportation Company purchased six cars, including No. 552, from Indiana Service. \n\nAtlantic City Transportation renumbered No. 552 to No. 299. Atlantic City Transportation operated a single streetcar line extending from The Inlet on the city's north side, along Atlantic Avenue in the city and to Ventnor, Margate and Longport. (A separate company, Atlantic City and Shore Railroad, ran an interurban line between Atlantic City and Ocean City.) Atlantic City Transportation provided most of its service with a fleet of 25 streamlined, single-ended Brilliners (termed the \"Miss America Fleet\"). No. 299 and the other Fort Wayne cars spent most of their time in the carhouse, but they were needed when parades and other special events blocked a portion of the route. In these cases, the company used double-ended cars, such as No. 299, for service on the outer ends of the route. No. 299 remained on the roster until streetcar service ended in 1955. Atlantic City Transportation continued to use No. 299 as a storeroom for company records until 1958.\n\nMuseum Ownership: In 1958, a nursery in Williamstown, NJ purchased No. 299 for use as a tool shed. In 1988, the nursery owner, Joseph Voschin, donated No. 299 to Seashore.

SIRT was owned by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, which also owned and operated freight service on the island's lines. Passenger service operated out of the terminal at St. George where passengers connected with ferries to Manhattan, while all freight entered the island via a drawbridge from New Jersey. Today freight service is confined to a container terminal near the bridge, and only the main passenger line, from St. George to Tottenville, remains. In the 1920s, the SIRT decided to convert its passenger service from steam to electric operation. For the new service, Standard Steel Car delivered 100 transit cars, including No. 366, to the SIRT in 1925. The fleet included 90 powered cars and 10 trailer cars. The cars used on the SIRT were 67 feet long and 10 feet wide, matching the equipment in use on New York's BMT subway system. This was deliberate, since the city expected to build a tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island. However, the tunnel was never built. The SIRT cars had some distinctive features, such as headlights, pilots and handholds, which were necessary to operate along with steam freight trains. While the Standard Steel cars were a rapid transit design, SIRT's operation retained characteristics of a steam railroad or an interurban. The route was semi-rural with numerous grade crossings, and fares were collected on board railroad fashion. \n\nWhen bus competition caused ridership declines, SIRT sold 30 of its Standard Steel cars to the New York City Transportation Authority in 1953-54. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority acquired the SIRT in 1971. The MTA placed SIRT in a sub-authority, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority (SIRTOA), to operate it. The New York City Transit Authority's R-44 car order was extended to provide new cars for the island. The new cars entered service in 1973, and most of the old SIRT cars were scrapped. \n\nAfter withdrawal from service in 1973, SIRTOA kept one old car at its Clifton shop as a work/storage car and preserved three more, including No. 366, for possible display at the Richmondtown Restoration (a Staten Island historic site). The Richmondtown plan did not occur, and SIRTOA kept the cars at various sites. In 1983-84, the Trolley Museum of New York acquired SIRTOA's four 1925 cars. TMNY took one car, trailer car No. 508, to its museum site at Kingston, NY, but vandals later destroyed this car. TMNY stored No. 366 and the other two SIRT cars at the Consolidated Edison Arthur Kill generating station on Staten Island. In 1993, Seashore acquired No. 366 when the Trolley Museum of New York decided it lacked the resources to preserve the car. One other SIRT Standard Steel car was saved and was acquired by the Shore Line Trolley Museum (formerly Branford Trolley Museum). With the acquisition of No. 366, Seashore owns vehicles that operated in all five boroughs of New York City.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Staten Island trolley 366 interior", "img_src": "781-L3iz4vnDY7tLSWMH9v8MVtEGXp7PcWqLDvjPEnlZ6rbbgsV6P5nmSjkgSY6m.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister car #393 car interior on 04/081973"}, {"img_alt": "Staten Island trolley 366 interior", "img_src": "782-8LtQ3SZAmWBlFknhGZHina8ZOlUfjlhyTOqtWxBNJumL5UM605sKIZNHcnKz.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister car #393 car interior on 04/081973"}]}, "136": {"technical_information": {"seats": "18", "control": "None (28A3)", "brakes": "AMU", "compressor": "None", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Baldwin", "model": "84-30AA"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "55' 3.00\"", "width": "8' 8.00\"", "height": "12' 8.00\"", "weight": "62000 lbs."}}, "title": "North Shore Line 415", "source": "Chicago, Illinois", "source_city": "Chicago", "source_state": "Illinois", "img_alt": "Red and Green interurban Diner", "img_attribute": "Norman Down", "img_src": "568-XlI1sXbgS8mRzIXs2i0QFnM3szf50IgcoxjGVO6vayDwUSQyRB2ZztwFZbVa.jpg", "builder": "Cincinnati Car Co.", "description": "1926 Cincinnati Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Interurban Cars", "year": "1926", "retired_from_service": "1963", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1977", "fund": "788", "car_id": "136", "history": "The Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee (commonly called the \"North Shore Line\") operated between Chicago, IL and Milwaukee, WI. Between Chicago's downtown Loop and the city's northern boundary, North Shore trains ran over the Chicago Rapid Transit's elevated line. Utilities magnate, Samuel Insull, acquired control of the North Shore in 1916 and made substantial improvements to the interurban's track and rolling stock. Insull's key improvement was construction of the high speed \"Skokie Valley\" line in 1926 which by-passed the slow route through suburbs close to Lake Michigan. In 1926, for service on this new route, the North Shore acquired 20 coaches and four unpowered dining cars (Numbers 414-417) from Cincinnati Car Co. \n\nDining cars on interurban lines were rare because runs tended to be short. The Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee's two-hour run between its namesake cities was just long enough for a good meal, and the company offered dining service on its express trains. In 1940, the North Shore remodeled Nos. 415 and 417 into tavern-lounge cars. The remodeling included decorations in a boy-and-girl motif, a J shaped lounge seat and new stainless steel kitchen fittings. The modernized diner-lounge cars made three trips daily-except-Sunday, giving breakfast, lunch and supper service.\n\nIn 1941, the North Shore introduced its streamlined Electroliners, two four section articulated trains which included snack bar cars. In 1949, the North Shore withdrew meal service on trains other than the Electroliners. In 1950, in order to provide snack bar service when the Electroliners were laid up for inspection or repairs, the North Shore line rehabilitated 415 and used it in a \"substitute Electroliner\" train along with two powered coaches. The remodeling included repainting the car's exterior from its original dark green into the North Shore's Silverliner paint scheme. The Silverliner scheme was dark red on the top half of the car, with stripes of light and dark aluminum paint on the bottom half airbrushed to simulate fluted stainless steel. No. 415 continued in substitute Electroliner service until the North Shore Line was abandoned in January 1963. \n\nFollowing the abandonment, many North Shore Cars were acquired by museums. No. 415 went to the Railway Equipment Acquisition and Leasing Co., aka. RELiC, which operated the Fox River Trolley Museum at South Elgin, IL. In 1977, Seashore acquired No. 415 from RELiC. For several years beginning in 1979, Seashore used No. 415 both for stationary food service and as an operating snack car for special events. As revenue did not exceed costs, this service was discontinued after a number of seasons, and the car was stored in a carhouse. The museum repainted the exterior to its original green color and removed the tavern lounge chairs. Lighting struck No. 415 which destroyed the car's wiring. Seashore is currently restoring No. 415 to its \"substitute Electroliner\" condition with its tavern lounge interior. The museum plans to apply the Silverliner paint scheme to the exterior. No. 415 still stands as the only extant interurban dining car.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red and Green interurban Diner", "img_src": "569-JskDk86Q3ADcBgo8aDRYrio6dcWsSmiKGiwH5UWSZIP8DihHB7bGwySAn1hS.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

The two snow sweepers were unique in that their brooms were gear driven, as opposed to the popular chain driven brooms of the day. Each broom was powered by a Westinghouse 510A electric motor. They were of a single truck design, whereas most of the sweepers of the day were double truck sweeper units. \n\nOn August 5th, 1958, the Ottawa City Council voted to phase out the city's streetcars and trolley buses. The last streetcar run was made over Ottawa's last operating streetcar line, the Britannia Line, on May 1st, 1959. B-1 and B-2 were sold to Cornwall Street Railway Light & Power Company that same year. After purchasing the sweepers, Cornwall scrapped their two sweepers, No. 1 and No. 3, and made B-1 the primary sweeper, with B-2 as backup. By the time of their arrival, Cornwall Street Railway was strictly a freight operation, with passenger service having ended on July 27th, 1949. Then on April 1st, 1971, Canadian National purchased all the rail operation, equipment, and right-of-ways of the Cornwall Street Railway. Almost immediately, CN decided to convert to diesel-electric locomotives, and on August 7th, 1971, CN ended electrically powered freight operations in Cornwall. \n\nIn 1972, Canadian National donated B-2 to the Seashore Trolley Museum; B-1 had already been donated to the Canadian Science & Technology Museum. \n\nNumber B-2 was shipped by rail to Kennebunk Station and transferred to truck, arriving at the museum on June 28th, 1972. In the first year at STM, a new roof was milled, the exterior paint was stripped and all the sash was removed for re-glazing during the winter. \n\nIn 1973 No. B-2 had its roof completely rebuilt with new roof boards and carlines as required. A new sliding door was installed, and the window sash renewed. The trolley pole was reinstalled and the exterior primed. The sweeper was operated for the first time on STM iron in October of the same year. \n\nNew matchboard was milled and placed at both ends in 1974.

So, the railroad was sometimes called \"The Great Third Rail.\" Other nicknames were \"Sunset Lines\" and \"Roarin' Elgin.\" Soon after utilities magnate Samuel Insull gained control of the CA&E in 1927, the railroad ordered 15 new cars, numbered 420 \u2013 434, from Cincinnati Car to supplement earlier wooden cars. The cars were 55 feet long, the maximum permitted by curves and clearances on the Garfield Park line. Interior appointments included rotating bucket seats, toilet facilities and a smoking compartment. While operating mainly on the third rail, the cars had trolley poles for yard service and limited street running. The CA&E rebuilt No. 434 in 1951. The car's paint scheme changed from blue to red.\n\nIn the 1950s, the CTA tore down its Garfield Park elevated line to make way for the Eisenhower Expressway. The CTA operated on temporary street-level tracks until construction of a new line down the expressway median. In 1953, the CA&E determined that operation on the temporary line was not feasible and stopped running its trains over the CTA. Many CA&E passengers, faced with the need to change trains at Forest Park, stopped using the interurban. When the CA&E abandoned all passenger service in 1957, No. 434 was stored at the line's shops in Wheaton. \n\n In 1962, Seashore arranged to acquire No. 434 and had it moved to temporary storage at the Chicago South Shore & South Bend RR shop in Michigan City, IN. In early 1963, No. 434 moved by rail to Kennebunkport and arrived in operating condition. Between 1996 and 2002, a member sponsored a major restoration project which put the car in excellent condition. The car is painted in the red livery it had after the 1951 rebuilding.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red 434 Trolley interior", "img_src": "761-fAKjS6dRb9Us3R7e6H3sLkqZlziDV0U1uAq0AnUMaW9kB10GJHR0BWxmT5Dw.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

These were lightweight cars similar to Cincinnati's more distinctive curved side cars but with flat sides. Nos. 860-899 were the last of 243 similar, custom-designed cars purchased by Georgia Power in the 1920s. These were the last new streetcars purchased for Atlanta. Seating in Atlanta streetcars was racially segregated. The 860 series cars did not have a definite dividing line; Blacks would occupy seats from the rear forward and whites vice versa. The cars carried Georgia Power's green and cream paint scheme used for one-man cars. Atlanta abandoned its streetcar system in 1949. In 2014, Atlanta opened a 2.7 mile modern streetcar line.\n\nIn 1950, during the Korean War, Korea Electric Company acquired 52 Atlanta cars for service in Seoul and Busan (previously known at Pusan). Cars going to Busan were mostly from the 860 series. The Atlanta cars replaced streetcars that had been damaged in the fighting. Korea Electric converted the cars to its 3' 6\" gauge and altered the front doors. Korea Electric renumbered the Busan cars into the 300 series, but Seashore has incomplete records to cross reference the Atlanta car numbers to the Korea car numbers. South Korea nationalized the Seoul and Busan systems in 1966. The former Atlanta cars ran until 1968. \n\nMuseum Ownership: As abandonment in Korea neared, Raoul Martin, owner of Seattle's Northwest Shortline Model Works, was traveling regularly to Korea and arranged to have Busan car No. 352 saved and sent to the Puget Sound Railway Historical Society Museum in Snoqualmie, WA. However, the electrical equipment, including motors, was missing. The Snoqualmie museum, since named the Northwest Railway Museum, decided that transit equipment was not part of its collection focus. So, the car was sold for a planned spaghetti restaurant in Las Vegas, NV. The car received some restoration work, but the restaurant deal fell through. Two Las Vegas businessmen, Gianni Russo and Anthony Marnell, bought No. 352 and stored it at a Las Vegas contractor's yard. Railfans saw the streetcar and persuaded the owners to donate the car to the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, CA. The Orange Empire Railway Museum decided that its focus was on items related to California and that it only wanted No. 352's narrow gauge trucks. So, a joint deal was arranged with Seashore. \n\nIn 1988, Orange Empire took the trucks from Las Vegas, and Seashore brought No. 352's carbody to Maine and placed it on spare Laconia, standard gauge trucks. This was Seashore's longest over the road move with its own personnel. Later, two Seashore members spent two weeks in Georgia inspecting nine disused Atlanta streetcar bodies and collecting parts for use in restoring Seashore's car to its Atlanta appearance. Seashore could install suitable 177-E1X trucks either from Cleveland No. 1227 or City Lines of West Virginia No. 115. Seashore Historian, Ben Minnich, termed this car the most traveled tramcar in the world. \n\nInitial inspection of pieces of No. 352 did not uncover the car's original Atlanta number. The number might appear during more intensive restoration. Seashore's curatorial file includes a handwritten list cross referencing some of the Atlanta and Korea car numbers, but not No. 352. Responding to a request for a car number from a possible donor, Seashore decided to identify the car as Georgia Power No. 876 from the car numbers not otherwise accounted for.", "additional_images": []}, "144": {"technical_information": {}, "title": "Boston Elevated Ry. 3617", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Orange bottom dump car 3617", "img_attribute": "Norman Down", "img_src": "874-XJE4T6Y3ZwJLa9gR3mJoO7y3KqMHZ61I4zhDnpvqZb8b6AUeG164giuRhScA.jpg", "builder": "Differential Steel Car Co.", "description": "1927 Differential Steel Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Railway Work Equipment", "year": "1927", "retired_from_service": "1974", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1974", "fund": "559", "car_id": "144", "additional_images": [], "history": ""}, "145": {"technical_information": {}, "title": "Boston Elevated Ry. 3622", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Side dump trolley 3622", "img_attribute": "Norman Down", "img_src": "876-CKfyaeJ8vKHwvwtWE7goMeCuuK0JqyOPBKGSknw6NZkiJbY8vmgGViIudhva.jpg", "builder": "Differential Steel Car Co.", "description": "1927 Differential Steel Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Railway Work Equipment", "year": "1927", "retired_from_service": "1975", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1975", "car_id": "145", "additional_images": [], "history": ""}, "146": {"technical_information": {"control": "K-35", "compressor": "DH16", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Brill", "model": "177E2X"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "West", "model": "510C"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "47' 4.00\"", "width": "8' 6.00\"", "height": "10' 6.00\"", "weight": "39240 lbs."}}, "title": "City Lines of West Virginia 115", "source": "Parkersburg, West Virginia", "source_city": "Parkersburg", "source_state": "West Virginia", "img_alt": "Pink trolley 115", "img_attribute": "Matthew D.

Kuhlman in 1927 by West Virginia Traction and Electric Co. (a subsidiary of West Virginia Utilities). WVT&E operated streetcars in Morgantown, WV and Wheeling, WV. Twelve of the Kuhlman cars went to Wheeling. Three (Nos. 113 \u2013 115) went to West Virginia Traction and Electric's system in Morgantown, WV. The Monongahela West Penn Public Service Corp. acquired the Morgantown system in 1927. The Monongahela West Penn served a number of small cities in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia and was a subsidiary of American Waterworks & Electric System. Morgantown streetcar service ended in 1934 when Sabraton Tin Plate Mill, a major employer in town, closed. West Penn transferred No. 115 to Parkersburg, WV. (The CERA Bulletin 110 on West Penn Traction reports that No. 115 went to the Clarkesburg, WV system in 1934, but other sources say it went to Parkersburg.) In 1943, City Lines of West Virginia acquired the Parkersburg streetcar system. No. 115 operated under the auspices of City Lines of West Virginia until the Parkersburg lines converted to bus in 1947. In Parkersburg, No. 115 normally ran on the Viscose line which served workers at the textile mill of the same name. Much of the Viscose line was on private right-of-way and included freight service which was turned over to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad when streetcar service ended.\n\nAfter retirement, No. 115's carbody was used as a dwelling. The owners offered the car to Seashore in 1987, but mud conditions at the site delayed pickup by Seashore. Instead, No. 115 went to a museum at the Hamar railroad bridge in Marietta, OH. In 2002, the carbody was donated to Seashore. Seashore placed No. 115 on Brill 177E1 trucks which are correct for this car. However, these trucks would also be correct for Georgia Power No. 876, and the museum might transfer these trucks to the Atlanta car.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Pink trolley 115", "img_src": "00115SWV-20020928-03.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

In the 1920s, the Eastern Massachusetts Street Ry., despite being faced with financial difficulties, made every effort to attract riders. The system offered tour guidebooks, all-day discount fares and made its cars as attractive and comfortable as possible. No. 7005 was part of the last group of cars acquired before the Eastern Mass. decided to convert the system to buses. These cars, of which there were 50, took the idea of comfort to a new level, offering thermostatically controlled heat, lamps with frosted diffusers, concealed piping, step lights and deep upholstered seats. These were among the finest city cars operated in New England and were easily marketed to other operators as the system shrunk. At various times, No. 7005 was based at Lowell, MA, Salem, MA and Revere, MA. \n\nIn 1936, after buying the Chelsea - Revere Division from Eastern Mass., the Boston Elevated Ry. bought 15 of the 7000 series cars from the Eastern Mass. The fifteen cars bore numbers in the same series as the El's trailer cars, so they were renumbered into the 4400s to follow other Eastern Mass. cars in the 4200 and 4300 series. No. 7005 became Boston Elevated No. 4400. The cars were by far the most attractive and comfortable on the El and were popular with operators and riders. In 1947, the Metropolitan Transit Authority took over the operations of the Boston Elevated Ry. The 7000s survived into 1950, but were retired after a large group of Type 5s were moved from Dorchester to Revere. No. 4400 (ex-7005) was the last former Eastern Mass. streetcar still running in New England. \n\nIn 1950, car 4400 (originally 7005) was the first MTA car acquired by Seashore. Seashore acquired No. 7005 from Minichello Brothers (a scrap dealer) who had acquired it from the MTA one month before. The MTA stored No. 7005 at the Bennett Street carhouse in Cambridge until the car was moved to Maine in 1952.

This line linked Harvard station in Cambridge with downtown Boston. It later extended south to the Dorchester neighborhood. This became known as the \"Cambridge-Dorchester\" line. The BERy equipped the Cambridge-Dorchester line with 95 cars, built in three batches between 1911 and 1919. At 69 feet long, these cars were the largest rapid transit cars ever built up until 1962. Thus, they were too large to operate on the Main Line Elevated or on the East Boston rapid transit line which opened in 1924. Most of the Cambridge-Dorchester cars had distinctive \"fish-belly\" side sills. Unlike earlier rapid transit cars, the Cambridge-Dorchester cars did not have end vestibules but had three doors spaced evenly along each side of the car. In 1927-28, the BERy extended the Cambridge-Dorchester line farther south to the Ashmont station. To handle this expansion, the BERy acquired another 60 cars from Osgood Bradley, Nos. 0695 \u2013 0754. (In Boston, rapid transit car numbers all started with zero to distinguish them from surface streetcars.) The 1928 cars were termed #4 Cambridge-Dorchester cars, but were almost identical to the 95 older cars. The principal difference was the door arrangement. On the older cars, the doors were designed to slide into pockets in the sides of the car, while, on the No. 4 cars, the doors were arranged to slide on the exterior of the car. This eliminated the accumulation of snow in the door pockets.\n\nThe BERy was reorganized as the Metropolitan Transit Authority in 1947. In 1948, the BERy modernized four of the #4 cars, including No. 0719. The modernization included florescent lights, ceiling fans and cushioned transverse seats in place of wood longitudinal seats. This set of four cars was dubbed \"The Braintree Train\" and was to demonstrate what service would be like on a proposed extension of the line from Ashmont to Quincy and Braintree over the former Old Colony Railroad line. (The Braintree extension eventually opened in 1980, long after all the #4 cars were retired.) In 1963, the MTA acquired a fleet of #5 cars to replace the older Cambridge-Dorchester cars. The MTA retained five of the #4 cars as spares: Nos. 0709, 0719, 0749, 0753 and 0754. In 1964, the MTA became the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The MBTA adopted a color coding system for its transit lines, with the Cambridge-Dorchester line becoming the \"Red Line.\" Of the five surviving #4 cars, the MBTA converted all except No. 0719 to work cars. \n\nIn 1970, the MBTA sold No. 0719 to Seashore for $1. The museum brought the car to Maine by rail on its own wheels. This required replacing the couplers with special, adaptor couplers. The museum quickly added a trolley pole and made repairs. Seashore has repainted the car Pullman green and has operated No. 0719 for some annual meetings and members days. \n\nIn 1988-89, Seashore acquired the other four surviving #4 Cambridge-Dorchester cars \u2013 Nos. 0709, 0749, 0753 and 0754 which the MBTA had used in work service.

Co. of Massachusetts purchased 50 lightweight cars, Nos. 555 \u2013 604, from Wason in 1927. These were a style of double truck, lightweight, safety cars developed in the late 1920s. In lightweight cars, the sides of the car body carried all the loads, as opposed to a center longitudinal beam in older streetcar designs. The cars were termed \"safety cars\" because they could be run by one operator without needing a conductor. Springfield offered these cars for sale when streetcar service was about to end in 1940. \n\nMontreal Tramways, under pressure since Canada was an early participant in World War II, bought 39 of these cars for its system, lengthening one platform and operating them as single-end, one-man, front-entrance cars. The front pole and rear controls were left in place for back-up moves. Montreal Tramways numbered the ex-Springfield cars Nos. 2050 \u2013 2088 and placed them in service in 1941. No. 570 became Montreal Tramways No. 2052. Montreal Tramways painted its one-man and two-man cars differently so passengers could tell which end to board as cars approached the stop. No. 2052 received cream paint for one-man service. The ex-Springfield cars, with 35 hp motors, were not powerful enough to run on some Montreal routes with the steepest grades. \n\nMontreal Tramways was taken over by the city-owned Montreal Transportation Commission in 1951. As the system began to contract in the post-war years, cut-backs of some lines increased the need for double-end cars. So, in 1952, the former Springfield cars had their remaining platform lengthened, restoring them to double-end operation. \nMontreal streetcar service ended in 1959. \n\nDuring the 1950s, Seashore members enjoyed visits to Montreal to experience an extensive, traditional streetcar system which had disappeared elsewhere in North America. When Montreal's streetcar service ended in 1959, Seashore agreed to purchase several Montreal cars, but the museum first needed to add storage capacity and to build a loop to operate some of the Montreal cars which were single-ended. The Montreal Transportation Commission agreed to store the museum's cars until Seashore was ready to receive them. No. 2052 came to Seashore in 1963 along with Montreal Nos. 957, 2652, 1176 and 1177. (Nos. 1176 and 1177 were used for parts and were not accessioned.) A year later, Seashore also enhanced its extensive Montreal collection with sightseeing car No. 2. Since double-end cars were needed for operations at Seashore and No. 2052 also represented Springfield, the museum chose this car for preservation. Museum members debated whether to restore the car to its Springfield or Montreal appearance. Seashore currently identifies it as a Montreal car. The car has seen substantial structural and cosmetic restoration. Seashore operated No. 2052 in regular service. However, Montreal had not adequately reinforced the underframe to support the longer platforms. So, the ends sag noticeably. In recent years No. 2052 has been held out of service due to additional needed structural work. A similar lightweight car acquired by Montreal Tramways from Springfield, No. 2056, is preserved at the Connecticut Trolley Museum in East Windsor, CT.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Cream color Montreal trolley 2052", "img_src": "473-n5zlrLPJTScdAnDyGfy6Wo9lHlANOcQPzN2xTD0QLXDU7ogeReI35rnNKOLf.jpg", "img_attribution": "Russel Monrow in 1965"}, {"img_alt": "Cream colored trolley 2052 in Montreal", "img_src": "474-NorDB0anTrqKxQZKyaCVjyVz7J8gm8mmn4TeWilk5w2CpZwiAEVlba1OLMh4.jpg", "img_attribution": "P.H.Bonnet in Montreal"}]}, "154": {"technical_information": {"seats": "26", "control": "NXFB2 Form23", "brakes": "Dynamic/Hand", "compressor": "none", "trucks": {"number": "1"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "USL", "model": "271V"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "38' 4.00\"", "width": "7' 3.00\"", "height": "12' 8.00\"", "weight": "26400 lbs."}}, "title": "Berliner Verkehrs-Betriebe 3412", "source": "Berlin", "source_city": "Berlin", "source_state": "Germany", "img_alt": "Yellow German trolley 3412", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "03412SDE.jpg", "description": "1927", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1927", "retired_from_service": "1967", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1973", "note": "Seashore cannot easily operate No. 3412 because the car's long wheelbase will not negotiate sharp curves on open trackwork.", "fund": "532", "car_id": "154", "history": "Lichterfield, a suburb of Berlin, is the site of the world's first commercially successful electric tram line, built in 1881 by Werner von Siemens, predating by seven years America's first successful electric trolley in Richmond, VA. Berlin completed electrifying its trams in 1910 and became one of the world's largest systems. No. 3412 is one of a large group of Class TM 36 center entrance, single truck trams built in 1927 for the Berliner Strassenbahn (Berlin Tramway). No. 3412 is an unusually long, single-truck car typical of European trams built between the World Wars. It was designed for the narrow streets of older European cities. In 1929, the Berlin Tramway was reorganized as the municipally owned Berliner Verkehrs-Betriebe (BVG). The BVG rebuilt No. 3412 in the 1930s to operate either as a single ended single unit or as part of a back to back train with another similar car. Complicated controllers and heavy jumper cables enabled the paired cars to operate without special multiple unit equipment.\n\nNo. 3412 survived the air raids of World War II. After the partition of Berlin following the war, No. 3412 operated in West Berlin. Tram service in West Berlin ended in 1967, although trams in East Berlin have continued operating to the present.\n\nIn 1968, the Berlin transit administration (BVG) donated No. 3412 to Seashore. Seashore acquired the car as part of its Great World Capitals Collection. In 1969, the car traveled through East Germany by canal boat to reach Hamburg in West Germany. Hamburg's tram system stored No. 3412 for four years until Seashore could raise funds to ship the tram to the U.S. Finally, in 1973, Seashore secured a bargain shipping rate from Atlantic Container Lines. ACL placed No. 3412 on a lowboy trailer and pulled it onto its Roll On/Roll Off ship American Song, traveling from Bremen, Germany to Port Elizabeth, NJ. No. 3412 arrived in good condition and operated at the museum.

Between Chicago's downtown Loop and the city's northern boundary, North Shore trains ran over the Chicago Rapid Transit's elevated line. Utilities magnate, Samuel Insull, acquired control of the North Shore in 1916 and made substantial improvements to the interurban's track and rolling stock. Insull's key improvement was construction of the high speed \"Skokie Valley\" line in 1926 which by-passed the slow route through suburbs close to Lake Michigan.\n\nIn addition to operating dining cars, the North Shore Line also operated parlor car service. In 1928, the North Shore purchased 15 coaches, two dining cars (numbers 418 and 419) and parlor-observation No. 420 from Pullman. No. 420 was unpowered, with 16 pivoting arm chairs, 8 seats in a smoking compartment, washrooms, a kitchenette and an open observation platform. The car carried an orange and maroon livery, later replaced with a dark green paint scheme. In 1932, just four years after No. 420 entered service, the North Shore discontinued parlor service and stored No. 420. During World War II, vastly increased traffic from the Great Lakes Naval Station made additional capacity necessary. The North Shore removed car 420 from storage and remodeled it into a coach. The railroad removed the kitchenette, smoking compartment and bathrooms to give maximum seating capacity. A full vestibule replaced the observation platform, and controls were provided on both ends. Two motors and a switch group were installed, and 420 returned to service in 1943 as a very plain coach. Only its wide picture windows gave away its former life. No. 420 operated in suburban service until the North Shore's abandonment in 1963.\n\nAfter the North Shore ended service in 1963, former North Shore employee John Horachek acquired coaches 420 and 755 as agent for Seashore. The two North Shore cars arrived at Seashore in 1966. Seashore has repainted No. 420 in green with red and gold trim, and the museum has done some other restoration work over the years. It is presently out of service with a motor problem. In 2015, the museum received a $10,000 matching grant from the Emery Rail Heritage Trust for restoration of No. 420", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red and Green Trolley", "img_src": "575-YU0SF2E55ov66mDEJxipqg2M2oPOES5CXt11ujcCcan9vBJFybavLefH2rOl.jpg", "img_attribution": "Jeremy Whiteman on 7/30/2006"}, {"img_alt": "Red and Green Trolley", "img_src": "576-2W8eIjldiWC63FxB8MDUEAp0ATM9MFs9muyql2xaKf7I6f06IRL4lwcgRGIL.jpg", "img_attribution": "Cars 420, 415 and 755 in a train \u2013 Fred Maloney at newdavesrailpix.com"}, {"img_alt": "Red and Green Trolley historic photo", "img_src": "577-SZcTvJsATlKDOLOvO3ytGolF4kujdHm5Q9oD788yLCM1wjtz72GfJo6Mw4ya.jpg", "img_attribution": "newdavesrailpix.com - 420 is lead car at Skokie IL."}]}, "156": {"technical_information": {"seats": "44", "control": "PC-10 (C-26-C)", "brakes": "AMLE", "compressor": "CP-28", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Standard", "model": "C-60"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "301"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "46' 7.00\"", "width": "8' 8.00\"", "height": "12' 7.00\"", "weight": "73358 lbs."}}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 0986", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Boston Orange Line Subway 1000", "img_attribute": "Sister car 01000", "img_src": "901-KQ3F2anWcJJM1YXWL3hrDor4y2JkRLipLm03OM9ZZPkCsSgYZEHWkh8rcJiq.jpg", "builder": "Wason Manufacturing Co.", "description": "1928 Wason Manufacturing Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Rapid Transit Cars", "year": "1928", "retired_from_service": "1996", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1996", "note": "Non-Accessioned, Material Storage", "car_id": "156", "additional_images": [], "history": ""}, "157": {"technical_information": {"seats": "44", "control": "PC-10 (C-26-C)", "brakes": "AMLE", "compressor": "CP-28", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Standard", "model": "C-60"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "301"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "46' 7.00\"", "width": "8' 8.00\"", "height": "12' 7.00\"", "weight": "73358 lbs."}}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 0996", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Boston Orange Line Subway 1000", "img_attribute": "Sister car 01000", "img_src": "902-ykXFzsSOQEu7f3NR52zngYORW4u00eZhYO8uGmK6eAPUiRlsPwfglk8S22MZ.jpg", "builder": "Wason Manufacturing Co.", "description": "1928 Wason Manufacturing Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Rapid Transit Cars", "year": "1928", "retired_from_service": "1996", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1996", "note": "Non-Accessioned, Material Storage", "car_id": "157", "additional_images": [], "history": ""}, "158": {"technical_information": {"seats": "44", "control": "PC-10 (C-26-C)", "brakes": "AMLE", "compressor": "CP-28", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Standard", "model": "C-60"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "301"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "46' 7.00\"", "width": "8' 8.00\"", "height": "12' 7.00\"", "weight": "73358 lbs."}}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 0997", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Boston Orange Line Subway 1000", "img_attribute": "Sister car 01000", "img_src": "903-gtmGSQFwAwKF5lzr9jJv6J2LruQ3lilmJFDHuBHUZ1POPL1hoQKRU6rF2Ut1.jpg", "builder": "Wason Manufacturing Co.", "description": "1928 Wason Manufacturing Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Rapid Transit Cars", "year": "1928", "retired_from_service": "1981", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1981", "fund": "560", "car_id": "158", "history": "Boston opened its first elevated line in 1901.

It would appear that since the company had not made the official decision to convert to buses, the No. 116 was initially used for training purposes. The only major modification made to the bus while in service was the replacement of it motor. It was originally powered by a Hall-Scott 4-cylinder motor, but it soon proved that the bus was severely underpowered, so it was replaced with a 6-cylinder flat head motor of Twin Coach design. \n\nNumber 116 remained in service until 1963, spending its last years of service towing disabled buses back to the car barn in Merrimac, MA. It ended its career when it blew a head gasket while attempting to tow a bus back from the White Mountains of NH. It was then towed back to the Merrimac car barn, and was stored outside unserviceable. At some point, it was jacked up and the tires and rims were removed for use on other vehicles. The receivers were asking $10,000.00 for the bus, believing that after they had replaced the rims and tires the bus justified the cost since it was now an antique. However, it failed to be sold when the remaining equipment was auctioned off. The bus then became property of Brox Construction when they bought the Merrimac car barn property and the equipment on it. This included No. 116, plus a treasure trove of streetcar parts and tools. The Seashore Trolley Museum was able to recover some of the materials, notably two floor jacks for jacking up streetcars. No. 116 was purchased by a member of Seashore for the princely sum of $150.00 \u2013 a far cry from $10,000.00.\n\nNumber 116 was the product of a bus industry in its infancy. Like the automobile business at the time, there were a lot of companies in the business and only the fittest survived. The evolution of the companies is a study unto itself. No. 116 was built by American Car and Foundry Motor Company in 1929. ACF Motors' story begins with the creation of American Car & Foundry Company (ACF) in 1899. ACF was what is termed a 'car trust', and was a holding company with the goal of controlling the manufacturing of railroad rolling stock, interurbans and streetcars by eliminating competition by association, acquisition, hostile takeover or putting them out of business. When it was organized as a corporation in 1899, its 13 members represented 52% of rolling stock production, other than that produced by railroad-owned shops. By 1905, it controlled a total of 18 companies. At one point, there was talk of Pullman being absorbed by ACF. Its biggest competition in the streetcar and interurban market was J. G. Brill.\n\nIn the 1920s, the demand for interurbans and streetcars began to decline, so ACF began looking for opportunities in forms of transportation. In 1922, ACF ventured into the rubber tired arena with the purchase of Carter Carburetor Corporation. ACF targeted the growing motor coach market, and began working with J. G. Brill on acquiring control of Hall-Scott Motor Company, maker of gasoline engines, Fageol Motors Company of Ohio and Fageol Motors Company of Oakland, manufacturers of coach bodies. American Car & Foundry Motors was incorporated in 1925 and controlled Hall-Scott and Fageol Motors Company of Ohio through stock ownership. In 1926, the holding company Brill Corporation was created to acquire the stock of ACF Motors and J. G. Brill. American Car and Foundry owned 65% of Brill Corporation's stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of the creation of the holding company, the two subsidiaries controlled the following:\n\nAmerican Car & Foundry Motors:\t\t100%\t\tHall-Scott\n\t\t\t\t\t\t 90%\t\tFageol Motors Co. of Ohio\n\nJ.

Brill (France)\n\nAlthough controlled by Brill Corporation, ACF Motors and J.G. Brill were not merged together until 1944 to form the ACF-Brill Motors Company. \n\nAmerican Car and Foundry Motors Company\n\nAmerican Car & Foundries Motors\t\tDetroit, MI\t\t1925-1932\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBerwick, PA\t\t1932-1944\nACF-Brill Motors Company\t\t\tBerwick, PA\t\t1944-1946\nACF-Brill Subsidiary of Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation\n\t\t\t\t\tNashville, Tennessee\t1946-1954 \n\nMuseum Ownership: In 1964 Number 116 Brox Construction sold Number 116 to Frank J. Welch, a member of Seashore Trolley Museum. Inside the bus above the driver's seat someone had written \"Save old Hanks\", so the bus was nicknamed Nancy Hanks \u2013 the mother of Abraham Lincoln. Frank and Paul Castiglione became the team leaders for the restoration of the bus. While it was stored at the Merrimac site, the bus was vandalized \u2013 most of the glass had been broken. The spark plugs had been removed, and the cylinders filled with water. The bus was moved to a safer location Eastern Street Railway's Lawrence, MA. car barn and moved again to a more secure location at Trombly Motor Coach Service on Lupine Road in Andover, MA. While in Andover, the motor was stripped down to its basic components to determine the work required to get it operation again, the availability of parts and the cost of the required work. It was noted that the cylinder walls were badly rusted when vandal removed the plugs. The windshield was replaced, but the rest of the windows with broken glass were covered with plastic. There was only one passenger seat remaining in the bus, directly behind the driver's seat. Replacement seats were secured, but they did not match the original seat, but it was thought they could be modified make a close resemblance. A small section of the roof under the luggage was removed and replaced in order to determine the best practice to complete it restoration. Also, a piece of the header over the door had to be replaced, but had to be carefully shaped and drilled to match the section it was replacing. The information available on the bus boasted that the framing pieces were made out of white oak. When the header from the bus was taken to a lumber yard to make up a replacement, it was found that it was not white oak, but an inferior quality southern yellow pine. Massachusetts Northeastern was not quite getting what they paid for. \n\nNumber 116 was acquired by Seashore Trolley Museum in 1969 and arrived here on January 18th of the same year. It had to be moved from Trombly's Andover yard to free up storage space. The coach company had taken over the former Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway bus routes in the Lawrence area and needed the room for the additional buses. \n\nNo. 116 is the second piece of Massachusetts Northeastern Street Railway equipment acquired by Seashore Trolley Museum.

Brill Co. introduced its sleek, lightweight \"Master Unit\" design in an effort to stimulate streetcar sales. The design was based on the creation of cars of varying size built from uniform side and end sections. However, the stock market crash intervened, and Brill built only 62 \"Master Unit\" cars, of which 40 were exported to South America. Brill affiliates, Kuhlman and American Car built a few more. Lynchburg Traction & Light in Lynchburg, VA was the largest domestic purchaser of Brill \"Master Units.\" No. 115 was one of 20 \"Master Units\" which completely replaced Lynchburg's fleet of older trolleys which dated to 1911 or earlier. One man could operate the \"Master Unit\" cars while the older cars needed a motorman and a conductor. No. 115 was one of a group of 10 \"Master Units\" sold to the Roanoke Railway & Electric in 1938 when LT&L converted some lines to buses. At Roanoke the former Lynchburg cars became Nos. 48 to 57. No. 115 became No. 51. Roanoke Railway & Electric painted these cars crimson and cream with silver roofs. The Lynchburg and Roanoke companies were both owned by Central Public Utilities Corp.

In 1925, utilities magnate, Samuel Insull, acquired control of the line and reorganized it as the Chicago South Shore & South Bend Railroad. Insull undertook a massive rejuvenation with improved track, stations and electrical systems. Insull gained trackage rights over the Illinois Central Railroad for through service to downtown Chicago. The upgrades also included a new fleet of heavyweight, steel cars to replace the old CLS&SB wood cars. Between 1926 and 1929, the South Shore acquired 52 steel passenger cars. No. 32 is one of 15 coaches (No. 10 and Nos. 26-39) purchased from Standard Steel Car in 1929. The 1929 order from Standard Steel also included two unpowered coaches and two parlor cars. No. 32 featured bucket seats and an enclosed smoking compartment. Between 1943 and 1951, the South Shore modernized about half of its passenger fleet by lengthening the cars, installing large, picture windows and adding air conditioning, but No. 32 did not get this treatment. The South Shore's heavyweight steel cars remained in service until replacement by new, state-financed cars in 1983.\n\nThe Insull upgrades, the IC's main line access to Chicago and a thriving freight business serving heavy industry in northern Indiana helped make the South Shore the nation's only surviving electric interurban. Passenger Service is now operated by the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District. Freight service is privately owned and still operates as the Chicago South Shore & South Bend Railroad. \n \nIn 1983, the National Park Service acquired No. 32 along with 17 other South Shore heavyweight cars for a planned shuttle from the South Shore to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Many of the other South Shore heavyweight cars went to museums or private ownership. The Park Service stored its cars inside the Abex Stanray plant in Hammond, IN and later in a U.S. Steel bar mill at Gary, IN. The rail shuttle was never built. So, in 1989, the Park Service offered its South Shore cars to museums. No. 32 came to Seashore on a ten year loan from the National Park Service. In 2010, the museum acquired ownership from the Park Service. The NPS asked to maintain an ongoing working relationship with Seashore through the joint development of interpretive media, and the NPS sought to provide for No. 32's long-term preservation. \n\nAt Seashore, No. 32 joined cars from the other two principal Chicago-area interurbans that had also been controlled by Samuel Insull. These other cars \u2013 Chicago Aurora & Elgin No. 434 and Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee Nos. 415, 420 and 755 \u2013 were all built in the same era as No. 32 as part of Insull's fleet upgrades.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "orange trolley 32 historical photo", "img_src": "753-xkgoJ3K0ER8gev8hiBTira0DGaT5dzDIxedbGTYrIf6bI5uQDd0mEgSLymk5.jpg", "img_attribution": "At Michigan City old shops at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "166": {"technical_information": {"seats": "89", "trucks": {"number": "2", "model": "12DP)8P1/2CP3"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "General Electric", "model": "703"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "65' 0.00\"", "width": "10' 4.00\"", "height": "13' 6.00\"", "weight": "121950 lbs."}}, "title": "Long Island Rail Road 4137", "source": "New York", "source_city": "New York", "source_state": "USA", "img_alt": "Long Island Railroad car", "img_attribute": "Kenyon F.

The Long Island Rail Road was the first steam railroad to extensively electrify its operations. Its first electric operation was the line between Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn and Jamaica, Queens using a fleet of 134 MP41 cars. George Gibbs designed these cars which were similar to the first all steel \"Gibbs\" cars for the Interborough Rapid Transit, one of which \u2013 No. 3352 \u2013 is at Seashore. The Long Island Rail Road acquired its first, larger, MP54 cars in 1908 to provide service to New York's Pennsylvania Station, then under construction. The cars made the inaugural run into Pennsylvania Station when it opened in 1910. The LIRR continued acquiring MP54s until the final order of 45 cars from American Car & Foundry in 1930, which included No. 4137. \n\nThe MP54 designation refers to \"Motor Passenger\" and a passenger compartment 54 feet long. Top speed was 65 mph. The MP54 cars gave the Long Island Rail Road standardized efficiency but some thought they lacked comfort for riders. The cars were not air conditioned. While railroad coaches were rarely air conditioned in the 1930s, by the end of the MP54s service life, air conditioning was standard on most other commuter cars. The MP54s were known for their round porthole windows on the cars' ends. \n\nBeginning in 1915, the Pennsylvania Railroad, parent company of the Long Island Rail Road, acquired a fleet of almost 500 MP54s, nearly identical to the LIRR cars. However, the Pennsylvania MP54s received electric power from an overhead wire while the Long Island MP54s used an electrified third rail. Long Island and Pennsylvania Railroad MP54s were a familiar sight in cities between New York and Washington until their final operation in Philadelphia in 1981. \n\nThe Long Island Rail Road originally numbered this car No. 1137. The car first carried a Tuscan red paint scheme. The car received a light gray paint scheme about 1950. Then, when the LIRR modernized the car in 1958, it renumbered the car into the 4000 series, making this car No. 4137. The modernization raised the seating capacity from 72 to 89 by changing from two seats on each side of the aisle to 3-2 seating. At this time, the LIRR also applied dark gray paint on the car sides and orange paint on the car ends for improved visibility. Some newer LIRR MP54s had an arch roof, but No. 4137 has the traditional monitor roof. The last LIRR MP54s ran in 1971, replaced by M-1 \"Metropolitan\" cars. \n\nAfter the end of service, the LIRR scrapped most of its MP54s and stored a few for possible preservation. While stored at Belmont, vandals threw rocks at the cars, which may be the source of the broken windows now on No. 4137. Seashore acquired No. 4137 in 1972. The museum did some structural restoration on No. 4137 in the 1990s.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Long Island Railroad car", "img_src": "841-3GlaXMJ5DJEKB0U7YCL4ShazQxSsv2fiwaOSwVEROtSxAEqmUsye3bCYpkMk.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

Catherine line, the city's most important east-west route. The lead cars, Nos. 2650 \u2013 2674, were rear-entrance, two-man, pre-payment cars similar to cars acquired in 1927, but featured Westinghouse's new VA (Variable Automatic) control system. Montreal Tramways painted its one-man and two-man cars differently so passengers could tell which end to board as cars approached the stop. No. 2062 received green paint for two-man, rear-entrance service. Due to declining ridership in the Depression, Montreal stopped using two car trains in 1934. Montreal Tramways removed the couplers, and both lead and trailing cars operated as single cars. The 2650 series cars often ran on the Ste. Catherine Street line until replaced by buses. The 2650s were fast cars and found their way to the Lachine line where their speed could be better appreciated. \n\nMontreal Tramways was taken over by the city-owned Montreal Transportation Commission in 1951. Montreal streetcar service ended in 1959.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Seashore members enjoyed visits to Montreal to experience an extensive, traditional streetcar system which had disappeared elsewhere in North America. When Montreal's streetcar service ended in 1959, Seashore agreed to purchase several Montreal cars. As the most modern traditional cars in the system, Seashore decided to preserve a 2650 series car. So, No. 2652 represents the traditional layout of Montreal's two-man cars. The museum first needed to add storage capacity and to build a loop to operate Montreal's single-ended cars. The Montreal Transportation Commission agreed to store the museum's cars until Seashore was ready to receive them. No. 2652 came to Seashore in 1963 along with Montreal Nos. 957, 2052, 1176 and 1177. (Nos. 1176 and 1177 were used for parts and were not accessioned.) A year later, Seashore also enhanced its extensive Montreal collection with sightseeing car No. 2.

A branch served Columbus, OH. The C&LE, led by Thomas Conway, undertook improvements to compete more effectively with the highways and steam railroads. Conway's most prominent move was acquiring 20 new, high-speed, lightweight passenger cars in 1930 for the 285 mile trip between Cincinnati and Detroit. One of these \"Red Devils,\" No. 118, later went to the Cedar Rapids & Iowa City Ry. and is now at Seashore. Also in 1930, Cincinnati Car Co. built 15 freight motors (Nos. 635 \u2013 649) for the Cincinnati & Lake Erie. This fleet was designed for fast express and less-than-carload freight service. For these vehicles, Cincinnati Car used some parts salvaged from older interurban passenger cars. No. 648 included parts from Ohio Electric Railway cars built in 1911. The freight motors were powered through trolley poles and were equipped with controls for a motorman. Aside from the motorman's cab, the interior was an empty space for freight which could be loaded through large, sliding doors in the center of each side, similar to a railroad box car. The C&LE typically used a single freight motor to pull several freight cars but could also couple more than one freight motor in MU operation.\n\nWhen the C&LE ended service in 1939, all 15 of the 1930 freight motors were acquired by other operators. Nos. 641 and 648 went to the Tulsa-Sapulpa Union Traction Co. The Tulsa-Sapulpa renumbered No. 648 to No. 202. No. 641 became No. 203 at the T-SU. During World War II, T-SU painted No. 202 to publicize war bonds. The TSU operated the two former C&LE freight motors until 1955 when it purchased two second-hand Westinghouse electric locomotives. The T-SU sold the Nos. 202 and 203 to Leonard Nolen, a salvage operator at Sand Springs, OK, when then sold them to Borg Compressed Metal Corporation in Tulsa. No. 203 was eventually scrapped. The T-SU dieselized in 1959. \n\nSeashore purchased T-SU No. 202 from Borg Compressed Metal in 1974, but did not move it to Kennebunkport until 1976. It was stored outside. \n\nIn 1995 No. 648 was moved into the shop and restoration work begun. Sheathing, which had been covered with chicken wire to prevent it from blowing away during the car's trip east, was replaced. The roof was removed and the roof ribs, top sills and exterior letterboard were cleaned of rust and painted. Sheets of OSB were used to cover the roof skeleton. Milled tongue and groove for the roof was purchased and then stored in the car. No. 648 was then tarped and stored outside. \n\nWork started again in 2008, concentrating on the metal work from the front end back to the large side doors. Rivets holding the frame channels and angles together were cut out. Steel plates were purchased to replace badly deteriorated sections.

The C&LE, led by Thomas Conway, undertook improvements to compete more effectively with automobile travel. In 1930, the Cincinnati Car Co. built for the Cincinnati & Lake Erie Railroad a fleet of 20 radically new high speed lightweight cars constructed largely of aluminum and equipped with four 100 horsepower motors. Numbered 110 \u2013 129, they were capable of speeds of 60 to 80 miles per hour on less than first class track. The cars featured a rear picture window and distinctive horizontal fenders on the rear. No. 118 was one of 10 cars with a small parcel compartment near the rear. The lightweights operated on long runs, including a 285 mile trip between Cincinnati, OH and Detroit, MI. The C&LE painted the cars bright red and called the cars \"Red Devils.\" The C&LE publicized the new cars with a photo of the Red Devils, at a reputed speed of 97 mph, outrunning an airplane in a race. The C&LE high-speed cars were models for a fleet of 35 almost identical lightweight cars built for the Indiana Railroad in 1931. One of the Indiana Railroad cars later became Lehigh Valley Transit #1030 which is also at Seashore. The steam railroads followed a few years later with lightweight materials for their streamliners. Abandonment of the C&LE began in 1937. In 1939, the C&LE sold six of the Red Devils to the Cedar Rapids & Iowa City Railway (commonly called the CRANDIC) and 13 of the cars to the Lehigh Valley Transit in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Cedar Rapids and Iowa City was one of the most financially successful interurbans over a long period of time. Cedar Rapids and Iowa City lie 27 miles apart on a north-south axis in eastern Iowa. On this route, with 14 intermediate stops, the high-speed cars shortened the schedule from 60 minutes to 50 minutes. No. 118 kept its former C&LE number. The six former C&LE lightweight cars provided most of the passenger service on the CRANDIC. The former C&LE cars survived in this service until 1953. Because of corrosion where the aluminum came in contact with other metals, the CRANDIC replaced the aluminum sides with stainless steel. The CRANDIC also replaced the seats in No. 118. Originally, one-man cars, the lightweights were operated as two-man cars on the CRANDIC. Passenger service ended in 1953, but the CRANDIC prospers today as a diesel-operated freight railroad. \nSeashore purchased No. 118 in 1954. Various restoration projects have taken place on the car. Other museums had acquired some CRANDIC highspeeds and converted them back to their C&LE livery. So, Seashore decided to keep No. 118 in its yellow CRANDIC paint scheme and made a commitment to the CRANDIC management to keep it in their colors. No. 118 and its near-twin, Lehigh Valley Transit No. 1030, are probably Seashore's fastest cars.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Yellow 118 Trolley", "img_src": "562-JIVrqyKESR8QtW9gQB3fPY7HLeTsz52Lia90JpxzZcLRrMLz5KcGqpUMFOyT.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

The company reorganized as Baltimore Transit Co. in 1935. The BTC converted most of its lines to buses between 1948 and 1956. Its last streetcar ran in 1963. \n\n\"Peter Witt\" streetcars were designed by Cleveland Transit Commissioner, Peter Witt in 1914, and featured center doors. The center door was for exiting and a front door was for passenger entrance. The conductor was stationed before the center door. Passengers would pay their fare as they passed the conductor which reduced dwell time at stops. This \"Peter Witt\" style car, manufactured by several builders, became popular in Cleveland and elsewhere. \n\nUnited Railways and Electric purchased 150 Peter Witt cars. The last 50, Nos. 6101 to 6150, came from Brill in 1930 and featured mechanical advancements including a Westinghouse Variable Automatic control system and some cars (including No. 6144) were equipped with a W-N double reduction gear system. These cars were precursors of the streamlined PCC streetcar design a few years later. The mechanical improvements allowed smoother acceleration and faster schedules. Payments for these Peter Witt cars helped drive UR&E into bankruptcy in 1933. \n\nBaltimore Transit donated No. 6144 to Seashore in 1955. No. 6144 was joined by Baltimore Transit No. 5748, a Brill semi-convertible car which Seashore acquired in 1957. These are two of only three Baltimore streetcars preserved outside of Baltimore. The third is the body of a 1920 Birney located at Union College in Lincoln, NE. Seashore built a short section of 5 ft. 4 \u00bd in. gauge track and was able to run No. 6144 when it came to Maine. In the 1970s, Seashore volunteers rebuilt the trucks to standard gauge at the same time as Philadelphia & West Chester No. 62. The broad gauge axles from No. 62 were machined down to become No. 6144's standard gauge axles. No. 6144 has unusual traction motors, which feature a cylindrical steel main body with aluminum end caps. As steel and aluminum tend to deteriorate from a process known as electrolysis when touching, Seashore's shop found it impossible to separate the end caps so the motors could be serviced. The motors were subsequently overhauled by the MBTA as part of the arrangement for Seashore's lease of Claremont Ry. line car No. 4 to the MBTA in the 1970s. However, the MBTA also had difficulty disassembling the motors, and one of the aluminum end caps shattered. Fortunately, Ben Minnich had spotted two spare motors as he drove No. 6144 out of the Baltimore carbarn in 1955 and arranged to have them loaded onto his rig. One of these was successfully overhauled by the MBTA and allowed the car to become operable.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Cream colored Baltimore Trolley 6144", "img_src": "477-5Huw0bY0Wci3Et60WSGmbH6tbtwCxN8YTowXeuIEfX8KWUddyoDWIpz1l43q.jpg", "img_attribution": "Phil Morse on 07/31/06"}, {"img_alt": "Cream colored Trolley 6144 in Baltimore", "img_src": "478-izStVJ5pW75fqoyzkQxDBHEkRAkbKmr22hneXfUeOGDn0c8gi2bb7ipGB8zb.jpg", "img_attribution": "Fred Maloney Collection"}]}, "171": {"technical_information": {"seats": "48", "control": "HL (15B2)", "brakes": "AMM (M24C)", "compressor": "DH-25", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "National"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "548C2"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "51' 2.00\"", "width": "8' 4.00\"", "height": "12' 2.00\"", "weight": "68000 lbs."}}, "title": "Montreal & Southern Counties 621", "source": "Montreal, Quebec", "source_city": "Montreal", "source_state": "Quebec", "img_alt": "Trolley 621", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00621IQC.jpg", "builder": "Ottawa Car Co.", "description": "1930 Ottawa Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Interurban Cars", "year": "1930", "retired_from_service": "1955", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1955", "note": "621 is in good condition, currently stored inside Central Carbarn", "fund": "None", "sponsormanager": "None", "car_id": "171", "history": "The Windsor, Essex and Lake Shore Railway operated an interurban line between Windsor and Leamington, Ontario. When the line began operating at a loss, the municipalities along the line purchased the railway in 1929 in order to keep the service. Under new ownership, the WE&LS ordered five new cars believed to have been numbered in the 500 series. Ottawa Car Co. built these cars (four motor cars and one trailer) in 1930. Though somewhat heavier, the cars were Canadian versions of the high-speed lightweight interurbans of Ohio and Indiana such as Cedar Rapids & Iowa City No. 118 and Lehigh Valley Transit No. 1030 now at Seashore. These interurbans were early examples of streamlining. The WE&LS cars had 40 plush coach seats as well as 10 leather-upholstered chairs in a smoking compartment. They were lettered \"The Sunshine County Route\" with exteriors finished in blue with yellow trim.\n\nThe new, high-speed cars did not reverse losses on the WE&LS, and the company ended service in 1932. In 1938, the Montreal & Southern Counties Railway acquired four of the WE&LS high-speed cars, including one which became No. 621. M&SC applied a Pullman green paint scheme. The Montreal and Southern Counties was an interurban electric line built by the Grand Trunk Railway. It operated 47 miles between Montreal and Granby, Quebec. In Montreal, the M&SC shared tracks with streetcars of the Montreal Tramways Co. M&SC also had a short, suburban branch to Longueuil. The M&SC began operation in 1909. The interurban came under the control of the Canadian National Railways when the Grand Trunk became part of CNR in 1923. While No. 621 is a double-ended car, most M&SC cars were single end, coupled back to back in trains using a minimum of two cars. The M&SC shut down in 1956 after its tracks on the St. Lawrence River bridge at Montreal were converted to highway traffic. [See also: \"Memories of the Montreal & Southern Counties,\" The Dispatch, March 1996.]\n\nWhen the M&SC converted the outer end of the Granby line to diesel in 1955, No. 621 became surplus. The CNR donated the car to Seashore. The CNR shipped the body of No. 621 on a flat car to Portland, while the trucks followed. A year later, the CNR also donated M&SC interurban coach No. 610 and freight motor No. 504 to the museum. Seashore has repaired various components of No. 621 including the roof, doors and mechanics. No. 621 operated often when it first came to Seashore. At that time, an inadequate 300 HP Sterling Viking II gasoline engine furnished the power. With the fuel virtually being sucked up through it, loud backfires were heard for miles away. Eventually, at least one motor developed a failure. \n\nAfter the CNR donated No. 621 to Seashore, another CNR property, the Niagara, St. Catherines and Toronto, which operated around St. Catherines, Ontario, requested the 620 to 624 series cars (including No. 621) for further service on their line. The CNR asked Seashore if it would be willing to relinquish ownership of No. 621, but Seashore refused. So, the CNR sent the other four cars and a substitute fifth car of another type to the NS&T. Interurban service there lasted only a few more years, being abandoned in 1959. Requests from numerous trolley museums for cars from the NS&T fleet came in, but the NS&T refused them all, apparently not wanting to see their cars subject to deterioration if museums lacked the resources to care for them. Thus, the only reason that one of what was arguably Canada's most modern interurban cars was preserved was the refusal by Seashore to let No. 621 go back into commercial service.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Trolley 621", "img_src": "769-Tk1JySlhuoVWWo91NjVYdKxUkhdPyKcRizLQspifq2eqCICWNyUadiQmSsUn.jpg", "img_attribution": "Russell Monroe in Oct 1962"}, {"img_alt": "Trolley 621 historic photo", "img_src": "770-nXDyLtCF2uOic2M2JkQhjCTdxridjNtOETyEmiELq3NfVxfrtlOaXOY0M0qP.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister-car 620 in 1950 - STM Curatorial File"}, {"img_alt": "Trolley 621 historic photo", "img_src": "771-23bagWhHdkbM52cRYOxpkOvbSgpRFdLoSgZYhJWT0XZslbQiiqlX3CJQQSQK.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister car 622 by Dan Borgnis in July 1952 in newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "172": {"technical_information": {"seats": "74", "control": "HL (189D)", "brakes": "AMM (M24C)", "compressor": "DH-25", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Brill", "model": "27MCB"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "333VVD"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "62' 4.00\"", "width": "10' 2.00\"", "height": "14' 10.00\"", "weight": "67500 lbs."}}, "title": "Quebec Ry., Light & Power 454", "source": "Quebec City, Quebec", "source_city": "Quebec City", "source_state": "Quebec", "img_alt": "Red Trolley 454", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00454IQC.jpg", "builder": "Ottawa Car Co.", "description": "1930 Ottawa Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Interurban Cars", "year": "1930", "retired_from_service": "1961", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1960", "fund": "None", "sponsormanager": "None", "car_id": "172", "history": "The QRL&P operated the local service in Quebec City and an interurban operation to the shrine at Ste. Anne de Beaupr\u00e9. The line to Ste. Anne de Beapre opened in 1889 using steam power and converted to electric in 1904. This service was popular with tourists and pilgrims, and carried huge crowds spring, summer and fall. The winter was the line's quiet season, but there were always a few customers. Facing substantial snowfalls, the cars were equipped with huge plow blades to keep the line open. The Canadian National Railway acquired control of the QRL&P in 1951. Passenger service ended in 1959. The company's last new interurbans were six cars, Nos. 450 \u2013 455, built by Ottawa Car Co. in 1930. Until service ended in 1959, these cars carried tourists to the Montmorency Falls and pilgrims to Ste. Anne de Beaupre.\n\nBy 1959, Seashore had acquired some older wooden interurban cars and newer lightweight interurbans. Seashore sought No. 454 to represent a standard, steel interurban. The museum bargained with Canadian National over a price for the car and settled on C$1,500 \u2013 slightly less than scrap value. In 1960, No. 454 moved to Kennebunk by rail on its own wheels and then on the Highway Monster (Seashore's custom built car moving semi-trailer with rails built in) to the museum. Car 454 is by far the largest interurban car in the Seashore collection, both in length and width. No. 454 suffered damage while stored in Canada, at Kennebunk and outdoors at Seashore. So, the museum did extensive repairs, including installing new windows, doors and seats. Seashore replaced the roof canvass several times. No. 454 is in fairly good condition, having been painted frequently during its years as Seashore's designated snow plow. In 1985, Seashore restored the exterior maroon paint using a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum Services.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red Trolley 454 plowing snow", "img_src": "764-xGCfXRfcjpt8HMxldjpS6gucH6mT3pcAGoKkM3LyuKz7eU9USJrHyEE893eX.jpg", "img_attribution": "Jim Shantz on 08/28/12"}, {"img_alt": "Red Trolley 454 historic photo", "img_src": "765-dm8sEe7AXPHtwYVEtbsNBmjT4rSPSjULnyAVbzoUtXrVEvnEHXfdiRfT7vOx.jpg", "img_attribution": "At Quebec City terminal on 03/15/1959 - Joe Testagrose at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "173": {"technical_information": {"trucks": {"number": "1", "manufacturer": "Taylor", "model": "Taylor"}, "motor": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "General Electric"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "29' 9.00\"", "width": "8' 3.00\"", "height": "10' 9.00\"", "weight": "20500 lbs."}}, "title": "Mobile Light & Railroad Co. 49", "source": "Mobile, Alabama", "source_city": "Mobile", "source_state": "Alabama", "img_alt": "Mobile Trolley 49", "img_attribute": "Seashore Trolley Museum Curatorial Files", "img_src": "659-8VpQzdW5elQoQZy2coHh6lJNIiugsDtOYHP2SCm35BgA3vtngyBobH7VjHF7.jpg", "builder": "Perley-Thomas Car Co.", "description": "1930 Perley-Thomas Car Co.", "secondary_use": "Unknown", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1930", "retired_from_service": "1939", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1990", "fund": "768", "car_id": "173", "history": "Operating History: The Mobile Light and Railroad operated streetcars in Mobile starting in 1893. In 1930, the company acquired four streetcars, including No. 49, from Perley Thomas. In 1939, National City Lines acquired control of the company and converted the system to buses. No. 49 was sold for scrap in 1941. \n\nThe Perley Thomas Car Works was one of the builders that built cars which approximated the Birney design from Stone & Webster. This car is a variant upon the design, which uses a wider entrance door and wider aisle. This was described as designed so \"white and colored passengers could pass one another without making contact.\" Alabama had Jim Crow laws requiring segregated seating, but when the law was introduced in 1902, Mobile Light & Railroad opposed it and initially tried to avoid enforcing the segregated seating. Unlike most of Seashore's real Birneys, this car requires the standard Brill 79E1 Birney Truck. It was the last four wheel car built in the U. S. and the last built by Perley Thomas. Perley Thomas is the only traditional U.S. streetcar builder still in business, now renamed Thomas Built Buses and building school buses. \n\nMuseum Ownership: No. 49's carbody survived, but its exact use after 1941 is unknown. The carbody eventually went to New Orleans for a planned trolley museum. Jack Stewart, a New Orleans businessman, donated the body of No. 49 to Seashore in 1990 after plans for the trolley museum in New Orleans failed to materialize. No. 49 lacked many components including trucks, electrical gear and seats. Seashore made an unsuccessful effort to find a photograph of No. 49 while in service.

Between Chicago's downtown Loop and the city's northern boundary, North Shore trains ran over the Chicago Rapid Transit's elevated line. Utilities magnate, Samuel Insull, acquired control of the North Shore in 1916 and made substantial improvements to the interurban's track and rolling stock. Insull's key improvement was construction of the high speed \"Skokie Valley\" line in 1926 which by-passed the slow route through suburbs close to Lake Michigan.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1930, the North Shore renewed its fleet with 133 new cars. In 1930, the North Shore concluded this program when it purchased 25 coaches (numbers 752-776) from Standard Steel Car. This was the railroad's last passenger car purchase other than the two Electroliner streamliners in 1941. When built, No. 755 carried an orange and maroon paint scheme which was changed to deep green in 1939. The North Shore modernized No. 755 in 1940 and again in 1950. During the 1950s, the North Shore improved its image by giving some of its cars a streamlined appearance. This was done with a clever paint scheme, which simulated fluted siding on the bottom half of the car with alternating stripes of light and dark gray, butted against each other at one boundary and feathered into each other at the other. The top half of the car was red. The cars looked very attractive and were dubbed Silverliners. No. 755 was one of the first cars painted into the scheme in 1950. In 1962, the car was also one of the last cars to get fresh paint at the railroad's Highwood, IL shop prior to the North Shore's abandonment in 1963. \n\nAfter the North Shore ended service in 1963, former North Shore employee John Horachek acquired coaches 420 and 755 as agent for Seashore. Since No. 420 was an oddball in the North Shore fleet (a former observation car), Seashore also purchased standard car, No. 755. Car 755 joined 420 and several other cars in a rail move east. Seashore's cars were set out at Kennebunk Station, and Seashore's now-experienced car movers took over for the last three miles. All three North Shore cars at Seashore can operate around both loops since they were designed to fit on the Chicago Elevated's tight turns. In 2015, the museum received a $10,000 matching grant from the Emery Rail Heritage Trust for restoration of No. 755.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red 755 Trolley", "img_src": "578-U2gnjN5ynZS8bHvuzJVbcy2Xrq2SV4mJyHjgLtvg9dM9x5SI3IC3LliB4gdy.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

The Indiana Railroad was formed in 1930 by a merger of several smaller Indiana interurbans. That year, the new railroad borrowed one of the Cincinnati & Lake Erie's new, lightweight cars for some test runs. Impressed with the high speed of the car, the Indiana Railroad ordered 35 very similar cars from Pullman-Standard and American Car & Foundry. The cars were designed for speeds of more than 80 mph. One of the C&LE cars (later Cedar Rapids & Iowa City) No. 118 is also at Seashore. Built largely of aluminum, these lightweight cars preceded the streamliners on the steam railroads by a couple of years. The new cars were about half the weight of older, steel cars. American Car & Foundry built 14 cars (including No. 55) in a coach-lounge configuration with upholstered seats in a rear observation section. The other 21 high-speeds, from Pullman-Standard, were baggage-coach cars. The high-speeds ran from Indianapolis to Fort Wayne and to Louisville. In 1934, the Indiana Railroad converted one of its high-speed cars, No. 55, from a coach to a parlor car with lounge-type seating. The Indiana Railroad ended most service in the late 1930s. Of the lightweights, only Nos. 55 and 65 were sold for further use. \n\nIn 1939, the Lehigh Valley Transit Co. of Allentown, PA had acquired six of the C&LE lightweight cars. Then, in 1941, LVT acquired Indiana No. 55 to replace a former C&LE car which had been destroyed by fire. The LVT renumbered No. 55 to No. 1030. Although No. 1030 was operated as a regular service car, the parlor seating was retained at first, making 1030 a popular car with the regular riders. In 1949, LVT installed regular coach seats. LVT operated local service in and between the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton, and maintained an interurban route to Philadelphia called the Liberty Bell route. The 1000s were operated on this line, providing a fast, but rough trip to 69th St. on the west side of Philadelphia. The southern end of the line shared track with a suburban rapid transit operation known as the Philadelphia & Western, and like the North Shore cars, the 1000s were equipped with third rail shoes and door traps for that part of the trip. The LVT was probably the last example of a pure interurban, with passenger and freight traffic in interurban equipment, without railroad interchange.\n\nService on the LVT ended in 1951, and the 1000s were sold to a junk dealer who resold the body of No. 1030 to Seashore. No. 1030's trucks and motors were not included, since they were wanted by the Philadelphia and Western for their cars. The junkman substituted the equipment from a former C&LE car, which turned out to be the one from the famous airplane race of 1930. No. 1030 was Seashore's first car from outside of New England, beginning the museum's national and international scope. Over the next 24 years, a group of Allentown area members would gather at Seashore every summer to work on the car, and a fundraising effort was begun to complete the restoration of the car for the nation's bicentennial in 1976. Seashore restored the car to its LVT parlor car appearance. Car 1030 returned to service and was dedicated in memory of Howard P. Sell on members' day in 1976. Regular operation of 1030 disclosed some issues with the car which are being taken care of as funding is available. The most obvious of these is a result of the substitute motors, which draw excessive current and are not matched to the accelerating resistance. The proper trucks and motors are on hand and will be overhauled and installed when funding permits.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Trolley 1030", "img_src": "594-45BCsCzwWh7GtJDEP0trVIvN7fGCrlKTtk4k1uwNwSJzaGu2yvwa0bgon41G.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

At 69th St., on the western boundary of Philadelphia, the P&W connected with the Philadelphia Rapid Transit's elevated line to center city Philadelphia. In 1912, the P&W opened a branch from Villanova to Norristown. The 13.5-mile 69th St. to Norristown route became the main line and connected at Norristown with the Lehigh Valley Transit's interurban line to Allentown. \n\nIn 1930, the P&W responded to a sharp drop in revenues by turning management over to Dr. Thomas Conway, Jr. who had just revitalized the Cincinnati & Lake Erie interurban. Conway joined with J.G. Brill Company to design new equipment that would improve service and reduce costs. To design a vehicle with reduced wind resistance, Conway and Brill hired a University of Michigan aeronautics professor to test models in a wind tunnel. The result was a streamlined, lightweight, all-aluminum \"bullet\" car with a low roof and free of clutter. In 1931, Brill built 10 \"bullet\" cars, Nos. 200-209, for the P&W. The \"bullet\" cars cut power costs by 43% and reduced the running time on the Norristown line from 24 minutes to 17 minutes. These were the first streamlined electric cars in the U.S., the first all-aluminum cars and the first to have used extensive wind tunnel tests. This design predated the first steam railroad streamliners by several years and foreshadowed the streamline style that became popular for many products later in the 1930s. Brill hoped the \"bullet\" car would modernize and save the remaining interurban industry, but Brill sold only five other \"bullet\" cars, to New York's Fonda Johnstown & Gloversville Ry.\n\nThe P&W painted its \"bullet\" cars dark red with gold lettering and ran them exclusively on the Norristown line. In 1948, the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Co. acquired control of the P&W. The PSTC, known as the \"Red Arrow\" Lines, operated trolley lines out of the same 69th Street terminal to other Philadelphia suburbs. In 1953, the P&W merged into the PSTC. In 1963, the PSTC acquired the Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee's two Electroliner streamliners to supplement the \"bullet\" cars on the Norristown line. In 1970, the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, a state agency, acquired the PSTC and repainted the \"bullet\" cars into SEPTA's scheme of white with orange and blue stripes. In 1987, SEPTA began replacing \"bullet\" car service with used rapid transit cars from Chicago. In 1991, SEPTA finally retired the \"bullet\" cars after a remarkable 60 years in service. The cars' route has some characteristics of a rapid transit line, but, if considered an interurban, the line joins the Chicago South Shore & South Bend as the nation's only surviving interurbans, due in large part to the success of the \"bullet\" cars.\n\nAt their retirement in 1991, Seashore purchased at auction three \"bullet\" cars: No. 203, No. 207 and No. 208. No. 207 had been wrecked and was acquired for parts. Prior to retirement, SEPTA had sent No. 208 to its Woodland Overhaul Facility for structural repairs. No. 208 was still partially disassembled when Seashore acquired the car but was in better condition than No. 203. While Seashore gave No. 203 a cosmetic restoration, the museum held No. 208 for possible restoration to operating condition. No. 208 received some roof repairs in 1996. Another \"bullet\" car, No. 205, is in operation at the Rockhill Trolley Museum at Rockhill Furnace, PA.

The city formed the Department of Street Railways (DSR) in 1922 when it took over the privately-owned Detroit United Railways. DSR became the first municipally owned transit system in the U.S. In 1941, DSR operated 20 streetcar lines with 910 streetcars. DSR streetcar operation ended in 1956. \n\nIn 1914, Cleveland, OH Transit Commissioner Peter Witt designed a streetcar for passengers to enter at the front door and exit at a center door, paying when they passed the conductor who sat just ahead of the center door, saving time at stops. This design became known as a \"Peter Witt\" car. Detroit operated one of the largest fleets of Peter Witt cars. Between 1921 and 1931, DSR acquired 781 of these cars. DSR's final \"Peter Witts,\" ordered in 1930, were numbered Nos. 3851 to 3980. This 130 car order is credited as being large enough to have saved St. Louis Car Co. in the Great Depression. Like most Detroit \"Peter Witts,\" No. 3876 has a distinctive flat sign box above the curved front. After World War II, buses and new PCC cars replaced most of DSR's \"Peter Witts,\" but a dozen, including No. 3876, remained in service until 1954. \n\nAfter retirement, No. 3876 went to the Ohio Railway Museum in Worthington, OH. ORM rehabbed and operated the car. It later fell out of service and deteriorated. Seashore members purchased 3876 from the Ohio Railway Museum in 2010. No. 3876 joined Seashore's other \"Peter Witt\" car, New York State Railways No. 1213, Baltimore Transit No. 6144 and Toronto Transit Commission No. 2890. Seashore also owns two more cars similar in heritage to No. 3876.

Car #341 was one of this class known as the \"Felthams\" (after their place of construction). The \"Feltham\" cars were the result of a complete vehicle redesign similar to the development of the PCC car in the U.S. at about the same time. No. 341 was one of 54 cars built for the MET which served London's northern suburbs. At over 40 feet long, the \"Felthams\" were relatively long and had a tapering body, large entrance/exit vestibules and a low floor height. A distinctive feature was the higher floor for the operator's cab. Rather than using overhead wires, London trams (including the MET trams) drew power from an underground conduit, similar to systems in Washington, DC and New York City. When the London Passenger Transport Board acquired the Metropolitan Electric in 1933, No. 341 became No. 2085. The car survived the World War II blitz, but the LPTB's policy was to replace trams with trolley buses and expanded underground lines. The \"Felthams\" were the last new trams purchased for London. After 1938, most of LPTB's remaining tram lines were in South London. In 1948, LPTB was nationalized and became the London Transport Executive. The last London tram ran in 1952. The tram system in Leeds acquired 90 \"Felthams\" from London Transport in 1950, including No. 2085, which became No. 526 at Leeds. Leeds painted its trams red and used overhead bow collectors rather than trolley poles. Leeds abandoned its trams in 1959. \n\nIn 1960, when Seashore was developing its Great World Capitals Collection, the museum turned to Leeds, which had purchased cars second-hand from London, for an example of a London tram. The museum purchased No. 526 for a price equivalent to its scrap value. The tram crossed the Atlantic aboard S.S. American Press, the same vessel which brought Blackpool No. 144 five years earlier. Unfortunately, the trip was stormy, and a large wave inflicted substantial damage to the tram which was carried on the deck because of the tram's length. Seashore, assisted by a grant from British Overseas Airways Corp., later repaired that damage. A subsequent re-wiring project was only partly completed. Seashore has identified the tram as primarily representing its period in London. London No. 2085 is the largest of four double-deck British trams at Seashore; No. 2085 is 40 feet, 6 inches long compared with about 34 feet for the other British trams.

A system of trams (streetcars) also served Paris starting in 1890. In 1929, the city council decided to replace its trams with buses, with the last tram line closing in 1937. For the tram replacement, the Societe des Transports en Commun de la Region Parisienne (STCRP), acquired many of its new buses from Renault. For Paris service, Renault introduced its model TN4 (with four cylinders) in 1931 and its model TN6 (six cylinders) in 1932. No. 2052 is a model TN6A designed for suburban service. The Renault TN buses had an open platform on the rear where passengers boarded and left the bus and where the conductor stood and collected fares. Passengers could also stand on the open platform to smoke. The driver sat in a separate, forward compartment. The buses had the standard Paris paint scheme of dark green and cream. Open platforms were characteristic of Paris buses, first used in 1911 and incorporated in buses acquired through the 1930s. The Paris open platform buses ran into the 1970s. The green, open platform Renault buses became closely identified with Paris street scenes.\n\nGasoline shortages during the German occupation of Paris caused drastically reduced bus operation during World War II. After the war, all the model TN buses were refurbished. In 1948, the Regie Autononme des Transports Parisiens (RATP) assumed operation of the Paris bus system along with the underground Metro subway lines. The RATP retired the last open platform bus in 1971.\n\nIn 1964, Carson, Pirie, Scott, a Chicago department store acquired No. 2052 and brought it to the U.S. for a promotion. The store applied a red, white and blue paint scheme, apparently inspired by the French flag. After the promotion, it donated the bus to the Museum of Transportation near St. Louis. The museum displayed No. 2052 and later put it in storage. In an Ebay auction in 2006, the Museum of Transportation sold the bus to Jeff Mitchell, a collector in Barre, MA.

Twin Coach was based in Kent, OH and became a major builder of trolley buses and motor buses. Twin introduced their Model 23-S in 1934. The Model 23-S was an early example of streamlined design that was becoming popular in the mid-1930s for railroad trains and other products. Another innovation was the model's aluminum body. The bus had a single gasoline engine in front next to the driver. The Model 23-S was small; it was 25 \u00bd' long and only 6' 4\" wide. The A-60, designed for intercity service, had parlor style plush reclining seats with two seats on one side of the aisle and one seat on the other. Twin Coach also offered the similar Model 23-R which was slightly larger and designed for local transit. \n\nRed Star Way was based in St. Clairsville, OH, which is 11 miles west of Wheeling, WV. An article in The Dispatch indicates that Red Star was a successor company to Lake Shore Coach, the bus operation of the Lake Shore Electric interurban, but histories of Lake Shore Coach on the internet do not mention the relationship with Red Star.

Fairmont, located in Fairmont, MN, began life in 1900 as a small machine shop manufacturing single cylinder engines mainly for farm uses, such as pumping water and cutting wood. In 1909 the Fairmont Machine Company began modifying pump cars by equipping them with their one-cylinder motors, which increased the maximum speed of the former pump car from 15 mph to 40 mph, turning them into what is known today as speeders. In 1923, the company name was changed to Fairmont Railway Motors. In the early 20's, Fairmont began designing and building their own speeders, equipped with their one-cylinder motor. They also began producing maintenance-of-way equipment. In the 1940's, Fairmont began developing HY-RAIL equipment that could be mounted on rubber tired vehicles, permitting them travel on railroad tracks as well as roads, creating greater efficiencies and flexibility for maintenance of way departments. On June 8th, 1979, Fairmont merged with Harsco, a diversified enterprise located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The last Fairmont speeder was produced by Fairmont in 1991, replaced by HY-RAIL vehicles . \n\nThe B&M originally numbered the car No. 1500. When the railroad later purchased a diesel locomotive No. 1500, it painted over the \"1\" on the inspection car, making it No. 500. No. 500 was powered by a 6-cylinder Waukesha gasoline engine. The car seats 8 people and is only 16 feet long. It is, however, larger than the more common gasoline \"speeder\" cars used for track inspection and for transporting track workers. During World War II, the B&M made No. 500 a \"Bond Car.\" It carried management and union representatives to smaller locations around the railroad to promote War Bonds. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 500 from the Boston & Maine in 1963. A crew of museum volunteers (who were also B&M employees and retirees) picked up No. 500 at the B&M's Boston Engine Terminal and ran it over the railroad to the siding at Kennebunk under special orders. Thus, No. 500 is Seashore's only rail vehicle to arrive under its own power, except for the short truck trip from Kennebunk to the museum. That same year, when the museum lost electric power for a few days, Seashore could still give rides to visitors by using No. 500 to pull Nagasaki No. 134. The museum has done extensive restoration on No. 500 with the potential of making it useful to the Track Department. Seashore has done mechanical work and has replaced the wooden sides and roof. Seashore applied a yellow paint scheme which was the B&M's work equipment color in later years.

General Motors acquired a controlling interest in 1925 and renamed the company Yellow Truck and Coach, although it was commonly still termed \"Yellow Coach.\" Yellow Coach merged into General Motors in 1943. During 1923-1943, Yellow Coach was a major bus producer both for long distance carriers as well as transit systems that were converting fleets from streetcars to buses. In 1931, Yellow began producing its 700 series buses with flat fronts and rear engines which was an innovation at the time. Later, some 700 series buses, including model 733, had engines in the front to meet the preference of some customers. Model 733 was a small transit bus with 21 seats and was used primarily in smaller cities.\n\nYellow Coach built model 773, serial number 733 984 for the Waterloo, Cedar Falls & Northern Railroad (WCF&N) in 1937 as their No. 35. The WCF&N was an electric interurban railroad with a 64-mile main line between Waterloo and Cedar Rapids, IA and with branches from Waterloo to Waverly and Cedar Falls, IA. The company also provided local streetcar service in Waterloo and Cedar Falls. The railroad began supplementing rail service with buses in the 1920s. WCF&N operated buses between Waterloo and Cedar Rapids as well as in local service in Waterloo and Cedar Falls. The WCF&N converted local service in Waterloo and Cedar Falls from streetcars to buses in 1936. In 1936-37, the company purchased 23 buses, mostly from the Yellow Coach subsidiary of General Motors, for this expansion of bus service. This included the purchase of Yellow Coach model 733 buses, Nos. 35-37, in 1937 for $11,010 for the group of three. These relatively small buses operated in Waterloo and Cedar Falls local service rather than on the longer route to Cedar Rapids. \n\nIn the 1930s, the WCF&N's bus paint scheme was silver (aluminum) with a red stripe edged in black. This was a standard scheme that Yellow Coach used on buses for many of its customers. After World War II, the WCF&N painted its buses traction orange and cream to match the colors on its interurban rail cars.\n\nThe WCF&N replaced No. 35 and other pre-war buses with newer buses in 1947-49. In 1953, St. John's Transportation Company bought the Waterloo area transit system from the WCF&N. The WCF&N continued bus and interurban service between Waterloo and Cedar Rapids until 1958. Then, a remnant continued with diesel freight service as the Waterloo Railroad. \n\nIn 1949, the WCF&N sold buses No. 35 and 36 for $700, each, to Watertown Transit Company, Arnold C. Travland, Owner. Travland was a banker in Aberdeen, SD, but no information about Watertown Transit has been found. Perhaps, Travland did not initially operate the pair of buses. Then, in 1951, Travland and a partner, Oscar Herbold, received the franchise to operate bus service in Aberdeen, SD. This replaced Aberdeen service operated by Hyde Hub City Bus which had suspended operations in May 1951. Travland's operation was named Hub City Transit Company and is believed to have used the former WCF&N bus No. 35. Hub City ended service in 1955 - the last local bus service in Aberdeen. No. 35 became a back yard play area/shed. \n\nAbout 1980, Seashore member Ira Schreiber acquired the bus from a junkyard in Aberdeen, SD. Schreiber gave the bus to Lincoln Transportation System (renamed StarTran in 1988) in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lincoln Transportation was the city-owned successor to Lincoln Traction Company and Lincoln City Lines. Lincoln Traction began replacing streetcars with buses in 1926, and the last streetcar ran in 1945. Lincoln Traction had owned two Yellow model 733 buses acquired second-hand from Aurora-Elgin City Lines, in Illinois, in 1943. Schreiber worked with Lincoln Transportation to restore No. 35. Seats were installed, and the bus was made operational. It was painted bright yellow with a red belt rail and gold lettering. It was numbered \"733\". The bus was used for parades and special events to represent Lincoln's original model 733s. During this period, No. 733 was operated along with a Birney streetcar body mounted on a trailer. The streetcar body was owned by a priest, Father Les Canes.\n \nIn 1998, StarTran donated their No. 733 to Seashore. The museum refurbished the bus and operated it around the museum site. Seashore has generally stored the bus inside the Fairview carbarn. In 2021, Seashore displayed the bus at the museum entrance for the holiday \"Prelude\" events. At Seashore, WCF&N bus No. 35 joins Lancaster No. 3 which is another model 733 from Yellow Coach. No. 35 is believed to be the only surviving WCF&N bus. It may be the only surviving Aberdeen, SD bus. There are no surviving WCF&N interurban cars.

In 1939, just before the start of World War II, Liverpool built its last group of trams \u2013 a fleet of double truck and single truck streamlined, double deck cars. Liverpool No. 293 is one of these four-wheel, single truck trams. It was known in Liverpool as a \"Baby Grand\" to differentiate this type from the larger double truck versions known as \"Streamliners.\" Both types were also called \"Green Goddesses\" reflecting Liverpool's green paint scheme adopted in 1933. No. 293 made the last trips over Liverpool's rail lines before their conversion to bus in 1957. For the occasion, Liverpool gave No. 293 a special last trip green and cream paint scheme with \"1897 - Liverpool's Last Tram - 1957\" lettered on the sides.\n\nMuseum Ownership: Blackpool No. 144 was Seashore's first British double deck tram, acquired in 1954. Seashore sought a streamlined Liverpool double deck tram which would be a contrast to the older, non-streamlined Blackpool car. The Liverpool Corporation agreed to sell No. 293 to Seashore for a price less than scrap value. After retiring the car, Liverpool temporarily stored it until Seashore could raise the funds to purchase and transport No. 293 to Maine. With assistance of supporters in Britain, No. 293, along with a quantity of spare parts, came to the U.S. in 1958. British Consul General Robert H.K. Marrett presented No. 293 to Seashore at Kennebunkports 1958 Memorial Day parade. When cleaning out the car's refuse box, a Seashore member found this note:\n\"Dear Yanks,\nTreat her gently.\nFrom the last tram driver in Liverpool.\nG.

In Manhattan, another company, New York Railways, also operated streetcars but on different streets. The city prohibited overhead trolley wires in Manhattan. So, trolleys used a third rail in underground conduits. New York Railways converted its lines to buses by 1936, but TARS chose to acquire new equipment to keep operating streetcars in the 1930s. Because TARS was not allowed to raise its nickel fare, it could not afford to buy new streamlined PCC cars which other operators starting buying in 1936. Instead, between 1934 and 1939, TARS built or rebuilt 335 lightweight streetcars in its main shops at 3rd Avenue and 65th Street. No. 631 was among the last group of cars built in 1939. Similar to PCC cars, the 1939 TARS trolleys included rubber mounted trucks and rubber cushioned wheels for a smoother, quieter ride. Other special features were dynamic braking in addition to air brakes, and a foot-pedal operated brake valve. Nos. 626-645 ran on the 59th Street crosstown line. The city soon mandated conversion to bus operation. After a delay due to World War II, TARS ended trolley operation in New York City in 1948. Trolleys continued in Yonkers, NY until 1952.\n\nAfter the war, using Marshall Plan funds, Vienna, Austria acquired 40 of the TARS lightweight cars, including No. 631. Vienna refitted the cars with pantographs and renumbered No. 631 to No. 4216. These cars received a red and white paint scheme in place of their original red and cream colors. Vienna used the TARS cars on single track suburban lines because they were too wide for the double track city lines. The former TARS streetcars ran in Austria from 1949 until 1969.\n\n \nBy 1970, Vienna had scrapped most of the former New York cars, leaving 14 in storage and available for sale. In 1972, Seashore purchased Vienna No. 4216 but was not able to raise the $15,000 cost to pay for transporting the car to the U.S. The car remained stored in various carhouses in Vienna. After intervention by the Austrian Consul General in New York, the Vienna Transport System agreed to store No. 4216 until May 31, 1981. Eventually, John Silber, President of Boston University, agreed that the university would pay the transportation cost so that BU could lease No. 4216 for a shuttle service on a portion of Boston's Green Line along Commonwealth Avenue, supplementing the regular MBTA trolley operation. BU and the MBTA could not finalize a shuttle plan by Vienna's deadline, but Seashore was able to borrow funds to pay the shipping cost. No. 4216 came to Kennebunkport in 1981. By 1983, BU and the MBTA decided that the shuttle plan would not be feasible. Since BU did not use the trolley, it was not obligated to pay the transportation cost, but it agreed to give the museum $7,000, and Seashore repaid the rest of the loan through fund-raising efforts.\n\nIn 1983, Seashore began restoring the car to its New York configuration. Vienna's track gauge was 5/16\" too wide for Seashore's standard gauge. So, in 1992, No. 631's trucks went to the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad shops at Derby, ME for re-gauging. Seashore completed the restoration and placed No. 631 in regular service in 1995.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "631 Trolley Interior", "img_src": "458-V4VLN5EdiuUAPDYcNNuPDQbKl2RmX2B3GvoS8MRh1vjeQ1c27ezVU1VhTEZh.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

Glasgow trams used an unusual 4' 7 \u00be\" track gauge, slightly narrower than the standard 4' 8 \u00bd\" gauge commonly used in the U.S. and Britain. To modernize its fleet, Glasgow built 150 streamlined trams between 1937 and 1941. As part of this fleet, Glasgow built No. 1274 at its own Coplawhill works in 1940. Constructed around the time of George VI's coronation, this group of trams was called the \"Coronation Class.\" The lower deck is quite comfortable and the controls are modern. The car is streamlined, with the ends tapered to a 30\" panel. The Coronation Class trams were the fastest trams to run in Britain. Glasgow refurbished No. 1274 to run in a parade marking the end of Glasgow tram operation in 1962. An estimated 250,000 people watched the final parade of 20 Glasgow trams. Glasgow was the last large city in Britain to operate trams. Only the smaller city of Blackpool continued tram operation until a modern light rail system opened in Manchester in 1992. \n\nThrough the efforts of Seashore member James Donald, a native of Scotland and resident in New Jersey, Glasgow Corporation donated No. 1274 to Seashore. The tram came to the U.S. in 1963. Members of the Order of Scottish Clans greeted No. 1274 when it was unloaded in Boston. British Overseas Airways Corporation partly underwrote the cost of shipping No. 1274, and BOAC temporarily stored the car at its Logan Airport terminal before Seashore could truck No. 1274 to Kennebunkport.

Seattle became the largest U.S. city without streetcars at that time. It was also the only city at that time where trolley buses formed the backbone of its transit system. Operation was by the newly formed Seattle Transit System under an independent commission. Seattle's initial trolley bus fleet consisted of 100 trolley buses built by Pacific Car & Foundry under license from Brill and 135 trolley buses (Nos. 800 - 934) built by Twin Coach Company of Kent, OH. The system acquired 72 more trolley buses from Twin and Pullman-Standard in 1942-1944, bringing the total fleet to 307 coaches. The vehicles came in with a flashy cream and two-tone green paint scheme. The trolley buses saw heavy use during World War II and again during the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle. In 1952, the system was reorganized as the Seattle Transit Commission. After the 1962 Fair, Seattle converted many trolley bus routes to motor buses. In 1964, the remaining Twin coaches from 1940 were renumbered 600 \u2013 659. No. 867 became No. 627. Seattle's total trolley bus fleet shrunk to about 50 coaches by 1970.\n\nSeattle had not purchased any new trolley buses since 1944. Some Seattle residents agitated to retain and expand the trolley bus system. In 1971, consultants hired by the commission studied the merits of trolley buses compared with motor buses. The consultants ran tests comparing a 1969 V-8 motor bus built by General Motors with trolley bus No. 627, which, by then, was old and worn out. The consultants recommend retaining the trolley buses in spite of the extra costs of overhead wire maintenance because of the trolley's performance on Seattle's steep hills. No. 627 operated at 20 mph up a 14 percent grade, but the diesel reached only 16 mph; on the 18 percent Queen Ann hill, the trolley reached 18 mph but the diesel could not exceed 9 mph. The diesel also required \"excessive braking\" on the downhill. \n\nIn 1973, the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle took over operation from the commission. The new operator, King County Metro Transit and known usually as \"Metro,\" adopted a new policy of retaining and expanding the trolley bus network. The old coaches continued running until 1978 when the Metro retired all of the old vehicles and installed new trolley buses, new overhead wire and a new power distribution system. Seattle has since expanded its trolley bus system, making it the second largest in the U.S. after San Francisco. \n\nIn 1980, Seattle's Metro donated No. 627 to Seashore. It remained in storage at a private yard in Seattle until Seashore trucked it to Maine at the end of 1983. Volunteers did some cosmetic restoration after No. 627 arrived.

In 1940, Delaware Electric acquired another six trolley buses from Brill (Nos. 656 \u2013 660) similar to the first batch. In 1941, the system was renamed Delaware Coach Company, and it purchased a final group of six 40SMT vehicles (Nos. 661 - 666). Between 1938 and 1942, Brill produced over 600 similar SMT model coaches for numerous cities throughout the country. Delaware Coach did not buy more trolley buses, but it overhauled the vehicles in 1950. In 1956, American Transportation Enterprises acquired control of Delaware Coach and began to cut costs. This led to elimination of trolley bus operation in 1957.\n\nIn 1959, the Johnstown Traction Company in Johnstown, PA purchased ten of Wilmington's idle trolley buses. Johnstown renumbered these vehicles Nos. 710 \u2013 719. No. 664 became No. 713. The Johnstown system was unusual since it was a relatively small city which was still running streetcars as well as trolley buses and motor buses, all privately owned. Johnstown had begun operating trolley buses at the relatively late date of 1951. The streetcars stopped in 1960, but the company president, Warren Reitz, favored electric power, in part, because abundant coal in the area provided cheap electricity. Johnstown's trolley buses continued running until 1967. No. 713 operated on the Coopersdale route carrying workers to and from the city's steel plants. \n\nSeashore had been unable to acquire one of Johnstown's streetcars.

Some PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes.\n\nAlthough an early participant in the PCC development program, Boston took a long time to place a large order. This was due to the use of left hand loading at subway stations and other locations. In 1937, the Boston Elevated purchased one PCC from St. Louis Car, but it lacked a left hand door which limited its use. To modify the PCC design for left hand loading, the ERPCC required a full sized mockup of any changes to the basic design. Since adding the left hand door required moving the right center door and the motor generator set, the cash strapped Boston Elevated took time to complete the work. No. 3019 was part of the first large order for 20 PCCs placed in 1940 and delivered in 1941. These cars were single units, and began service on the Watertown Line. They moved to the Tremont Street line as newer cars arrived at Watertown. They remained on Tremont Street until 1958, when they were rebuilt for multiple unit operation and reassigned to the Riverside Line. \n\nThe PCC cars continued under Metropolitan Transit Authority ownership beginning in 1947 and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ownership beginning in 1964. After 1951, the MTA had a large fleet of 321 PCCs, and the MTA added 25 additional second-hand PCCs in 1958. Pullman-Standard built all of Boston's PCCs except for the first car in 1937. When the MBTA adopted its color-coding scheme for its various transit lines in 1967, the MBTA repainted most of its PCC cars from their original orange and white to a green and white paint scheme. In 1976, the MBTA began replacing the PCC cars with LRV cars such as No. 3424 which is now at Seashore. Even after the LRVs became museum pieces, eleven PCC cars continue to run in regular service on the MBTA's Ashmont \u2013 Mattapan line. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 3019 following a minor control fire in 1974.

In these areas, Washington streetcars collected power from an underground conduit between the running rails. Most of the streetcars also had trolley poles for operation outside of the city center. Capital Transit made nine purchases of PCC cars over an eight year period to replace conventional cars such as Seashore's No. 197. Each new order reflected the latest changes in PCC technology. Washington's PCC fleet reached 489 cars. To fit its carbarns, Capital Transit used a short version of the PCC.

In 1956, a new company, DC Transit took over the franchise, with a proviso that streetcars be eliminated by 1963 in spite of opposition from DC Transit's owner, O. Roy Chalk. The last Washington streetcar ran in 1962. \n\nIn 1961, General Electric Co., in Erie, PA, acquired one car, No. 1304, for use in automatic train operation testing. GE equipped No. 1304 with an electronic package wired into its control system so that the car could operate without a motorman. GE installed a pantograph to collect power from an overhead wire but kept the car in its two tone green, white and orange DC Transit paint scheme. GE named the car \"Tomorrow.\" GE operated No. 1304 on its Erie test track for several years. These tests helped lead to automated operation on the Bay Area Rapid Transit in the San Francisco area. \n\nThe Columbia Park & Southwestern (known as \"Trolleyville USA\") at Olmsted Falls, OH acquired No. 1304 from General Electric at an unknown date. Seashore acquired the car in 1985, and restoration work began in the late 1990s. The restoration included extensive structural and cosmetic work, replacement of missing parts, and restoring the car's control system to its original state, which was a major project as no original wiring drawings exist. Car 1304 includes a display of the conduit plow used for power collection within the District of Columbia where overhead wires were banned. Seashore has restored the car to its DC Transit appearance.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Modern trolley lettering", "img_src": "386-ZPcadBIYLykWfdfVXocEK1NatTev1SyoMfLFSzuU33AuGnyWbsDlZVcGE3Qq.jpg", "img_attribution": "Todd Glickman on 8/04/20"}, {"img_alt": "Modern trolley lettering at entrance", "img_src": "387-P7UOZnYrvRtf821HyzZTbs2KzMJgbjFNvn3SCvQCsLGuWt7ZiwEcUmu39G34.jpg", "img_attribution": "Noman Down"}, {"img_alt": "Modern trolley rear end", "img_src": "388-4sMhYFaZAvQSyvY7Mi7WihDlxlaN9eSPRcQmRj43CG3BX2A3XSxdN4wOH57u.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

The first use of trolley buses in Dayton was in 1933. Dayton Street Railway suffered a major car barn fire in August 1932 and decided to use the opportunity to convert its single route to Brill trolley buses. The other companies followed, creating the unusual situation of five different companies all operating trolley buses in the same city. By 1947, all five companies fully converted to trolley buses, except for a few motor bus feeder lines. \n\nIn 1944, Dayton's City Railway Co. acquired eight trolley buses from Pullman-Standard, numbered, by tens, 306 \u2013 376. During World War II, the Office of Defense Transportation (ODT) designated Pullman-Standard as the only manufacturing company permitted to build trolley buses. During the war, Pullman-Standard built coaches similar to the 300s for various cities in the U.S. and Canada, including Boston. Pullman-Standard's trolley bus production spanned from 1932 to 1951 and totaled 1,863 vehicles, the largest of any North American manufacturer. \n\nDayton's five transit operators went through a series of mergers, eventually fully consolidating into City Transit Company in 1956. Dayton and Xenia consolidated in 1955 and the Oakwood Street Railway in 1956. The city of Dayton wished a complete transit consolidation and held up a requested fare increase until this was done. There were strong local feelings of affection for the D&X and Oakwood operations. Accordingly, the red or maroon strip on trolley bus sides memorialized Oakwood, and the robin's egg blue strip memorialized the D&X. No. 376 displays the robin's egg blue D&X stripes. City Transit President W.W. Owen continued to favor trolley buses. In the 1960s, he had the 300s rebuilt and maintained in base service, but these coaches were retired by 1969. Today, the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority supplements its motor bus operation with a fleet of 26 Gillig Bus Rapid Transit type trolley buses, making it one of only five U.S. cities still using trolley buses. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 376 in 1969. No. 376 was the first and oldest Dayton trolley bus to be preserved at a museum. In the 1970s, Seashore repaired the area around the base of No. 376's trolley poles and repainted the coach.", "additional_images": []}, "215": {"technical_information": {"seats": "54", "control": "Westinghouse PCC", "brakes": "Dynamic / Air Tr / Track", "compressor": "PC-2", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Clark", "model": "B-2"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "1432"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "46'", "width": "8' 4.00\"", "height": "11'", "weight": "36080 lbs."}}, "title": "Pittsburgh Railways 1440", "source": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "source_city": "Pittsburgh", "source_state": "Pennsylvania", "img_alt": "", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "01440SPA.jpg", "builder": "St. Louis Car Co.", "description": "1942 St. Louis Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1942", "retired_from_service": "1968", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1968", "note": "As of April 2017, No. 1440 was in Central carbarn.

It was a successful design with approximately 5000 PCC cars being built between 1936 and 1952 for systems in the U.S. and Canada. Some PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes. The city of Pittsburgh, home to the Westinghouse Electric and Air Brake companies, was an enthusiastic PCC operator, taking delivery of the very first production car in 1936, and 665 more over the next 13 years. Pittsburgh was one of the few major cities, along with others such as Washington, Boston, Toronto and San Francisco, to completely modernize its system with PCCs prior to major contraction of the streetcar systems. The 1942 order of 100 cars, numbered in the 1400 series, used a distinctive 24 degree windshield slope, later used extensively in Boston, but not on subsequent Pittsburgh orders. The privately-owned Pittsburgh Railways operated most of its system with streetcars into the 1960s, long after other cities had converted to buses and public ownership. Pittsburgh Railways completely rehabilitated No. 1440 in 1962. In 1964, the Port Authority of Allegheny County (operating under the name Port Authority Transit) took over Pittsburgh Railways and began converting most lines to buses. PAT removed the 1400 series cars from service in 1967 when it converted the East Side lines to bus.\nn 1968, No. 1440 was the first PCC to come to Seashore. The Pennsylvania Railway Museum Association (now, Pennsylvania Trolley Museum) at Washington, PA assisted Seashore in selecting the car, negotiating with PAT and loading the car for transport. Seashore quickly replaced the roof and repainted the interior and exterior. The exterior carries the Pittsburgh Railways crimson and cream paint scheme. Like other Pennsylvania streetcar systems, Pittsburgh used a 5' 2 \u00bd\" track gauge. So, Seashore replaced the wheel and axle assemblies in No. 1440's wide gauge Clark B-2 trucks with standard gauge wheel and axle sets acquired from Boston's MBTA but originally from Washington's DC Transit. Seashore also modified the tread brakes and track brakes to standard gauge. The MBTA initially turned down Seashore's request for the wheel and axle sets as they still operated a large PCC fleet and retained the DC trucks as spares. However, when the MBTA had an urgent need for an overhead wire line car, Seashore responded by lending ex-Claremont, NH car No. 4 in return for the four Washington wheel and axle sets. No. 1440 was in operation at Seashore at various times. Unfortunately, the paint used to refinish the car inside and out (and which was the exact paint used in Pittsburgh) did not hold up well and has deteriorated. This poor paint performance helped explain why, in later years, Pittsburgh's PCCs, though in good mechanical condition, often looked shabby.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Cream and Red Trolley", "img_src": "545-Bbf4g7YCTGwyAT8Qo3JcnPSCMQznDtcljBzidrbwADcKGvuT2crZsMUMEAef.jpg", "img_attribution": "Paul Kehoe in May 1971"}, {"img_alt": "Cream and Red Trolley Interior", "img_src": "546-KqW87h3Xtg0C4ty8qTCDpQP7aCYMKJC6ag6bADzJkqbQv8TKYZESoIakSXVX.jpg", "img_attribution": "Paul Kehoe in Sept 1970"}, {"img_alt": "Cream and Red Trolley historic photo", "img_src": "547-gxOqN9e2MeXluRGX16TQefHhj8jBwvpSBC5R4oaP1GJ3E2m2BLNUKhJeD09s.jpg", "img_attribution": "On Sixth Ave. in Pittsburgh - John Froyd Collection at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "219": {"technical_information": {"seats": "42", "control": "General Electric PCC", "brakes": "Dynamic / Air Tr / Track", "compressor": "PC-2", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "Clark", "model": "B-2"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "General Electric", "model": "1198F3"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "46'", "width": "8' 4.00\"", "height": "11' 1.00\"", "weight": "39020 lbs."}}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 3127", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "03127SMA.jpg", "builder": "Pullman-Standard Car Co.", "description": "1944 Pullman-Standard Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "City and Suburban Streetcars", "year": "1944", "retired_from_service": "1982", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1982", "fund": "549", "car_id": "219", "history": "The PCC car takes its name from the Electric Railway Presidents Conference Committee established in the early 1930s to design a modern, streamlined streetcar.

Boston placed its first large order for 20 PCCs in 1940 with delivery in 1941. In 1944 and 1945, Boston Elevated acquired wartime austerity model PCCs. Sources differ between 1944 and 1945 for No. 3127's delivery date. No. 3127 is part of a class of wartime PCCs with General Electric equipment which were normally based at the Watertown Carhouse. These cars replaced the \"Tremonts\" at Watertown late in 1945. No. 3127 is similar to No. 3083, which is another wartime PCC also at Seashore. No. 3083, however, has a modified raised roof and has Westinghouse motors.\n\nThe PCC cars continued under Metropolitan Transit Authority ownership beginning in 1947 and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ownership beginning in 1964. After 1951, the MTA had a large fleet of 321 PCCs, and the MTA added 25 additional second-hand PCCs in 1958. Pullman-Standard built all of Boston's PCCs except for the first car in 1937. The Watertown-based cars remained there until 1969, when the last car line running from Watertown was converted to bus. The MBTA then reassigned the cars to the Arborway, Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue lines. When the MBTA adopted its color-coding scheme for its various transit lines in 1967, the MBTA repainted most of its PCC cars from their original orange and white to a green and white paint scheme. In 1976, the MBTA began replacing the PCC cars with LRV cars such as No. 3424 which is now at Seashore. No. 3127 was retired in 1982 after a replacement accelerating and braking relay was miswired. Even after the LRVs became museum pieces, eleven PCC cars continue to run in regular service on the MBTA's Ashmont \u2013 Mattapan line. \nAfter its retirement, No. 3127 came to Seashore in 1982. After much troubleshooting, Seashore corrected the miswired relay situation, and 3127 was an operating car for many years. Volunteers have performed other maintenance and restoration work on No. 3127. A failed pilot motor caused a secondary failure in the starting resistance, which has held the car out of service for some time. Seashore has acquired representatives of each type of Boston PCC: Pre-war style (No. 3019), wartime with a flat roof (No. 3127), wartime with raised roof (No. 3083), Post-war with standee windows (No. 3221), Post-war with picture windows (Nos. 3274 and 3292), and double-ended (No. 3340).", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Cream and orange Boston Trolley 3127", "img_src": "475-fKgqrdALmnl9aibtdBqGKSynFtfaSi39R9B44gLucdDuPMXVKrER3xRUu1Ad.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

Some PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes. Most older streetcars had been double ended, but most PCC cars were single ended. So, companies operating PCCs had to build loops or reversing wyes at the ends of lines. A few companies, of which Dallas Railway & Terminal was the largest, insisted on a double ended PCC configuration to avoid redesign of their tracks. In 1942, DR&T ordered 25 double ended PCCs from Pullman-Standard. Due to wartime restrictions, Pullman-Standard did not build these cars, Nos. 601-625, until 1945. DR&T used a red and cream paint scheme, later changed to mostly cream. When Dallas ended streetcar service in 1956, these cars were stored. \n\nAfter 1951, Boston's Metropolitan Transit Authority had a large fleet of 321 single ended PCCs. However, the MTA still had nine old Type 5 cars running on two lines requiring double end operation. To replace these older cars, the MTA purchased eight of the Dallas double ended cars in 1958 and placed them in service in 1959. The MTA was pleased with these cars and needed additional capacity with the opening of the Riverside line. So, later in 1959, the MTA purchased the remaining 17 Dallas double ended cars, including No. 608. The MTA renumbered No. 608 to No. 3342. No. 3342 operated on the Arborway and Ashmont-Mattapan lines. The MTA applied its tangerine and cream paint scheme.

Boston placed its first large order for 20 PCCs in 1940 with delivery in 1941. In 1944 and 1945, Boston Elevated acquired wartime austerity model PCCs. Nos. 3072-3096 came with Westinghouse motors, fuses and flat, wood roofs. These cars were known as \"Commonwealths.\" No. 3083 is one of 150 PCCs later retrofitted with a raised roof cap to house ventilating systems. Later Boston PCCs were built with this air cooling system. No. 3083 is similar to No. 3127, which is another wartime PCC also at Seashore. No. 3127, however, retained its flat roof and has GE motors.\n\nThe PCC cars continued under Metropolitan Transit Authority ownership beginning in 1947 and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ownership beginning in 1964. After 1951, the MTA had a large fleet of 321 PCCs, and the MTA added 25 additional second-hand PCCs in 1958. Pullman-Standard built all of Boston's PCCs except for the first car in 1937. When the MBTA adopted its color-coding scheme for its various transit lines in 1967, the MBTA repainted most of its PCC cars from their original orange and white to a green and white paint scheme. In 1976, the MBTA began replacing the PCC cars with LRV cars such as No. 3424 which is now at Seashore. Even after the LRVs became museum pieces, eleven PCC cars continue to run in regular service on the MBTA's Ashmont \u2013 Mattapan line. \nAfter its retirement, No. 3083 came to Seashore in 1982. No. 3083 has never operated at Seashore and has seen no restoration work. Seashore has acquired representatives of each type of Boston PCC: Pre-war style (No. 3019), wartime with a flat roof (No. 3127), wartime with raised roof (No. 3083), Post-war with standee windows (No. 3221), Post-war with picture windows (Nos. 3274 and 3292), and double-ended (No. 3340).", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Orange trolley 3083", "img_src": "730-fM9cMmDZVfUiSlrlzAzBuxBOmYB7vYkaGMs72s9r0tW93EnsctOTWyV8eUAb.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

Some PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes.\n\nAlthough an early participant in the PCC development program, Boston took a long time to place a large order. This was due to the use of left hand loading at subway stations and other locations. In 1937, the Boston Elevated purchased one PCC from St. Louis Car, but it lacked a left hand door which limited its use. To modify the PCC design for left hand loading, the ERPCC required a full sized mockup of any changes to the basic design. Since adding the left hand door required moving the right center door and the motor generator set, the cash strapped Boston Elevated took time to complete the work. Boston placed its first large order for 20 PCCs in 1940 with delivery in 1941. In 1944 and 1945, Boston Elevated acquired wartime austerity model PCCs. In 1946, Pullman built 25 post-war style, all-electric PCCs for the Boston Elevated \u2013 Nos. 3197 \u2013 3221. Compared with earlier PCCs, these cars had a raised roof for a ventilation system and had small windows above the regular windows giving visibility for standing passengers. The all-electric cars could not be put in MU operation with the air-electric cars. Since all of Boston's other PCCs were air-electric cars, the all-electrics were limited in their use. The all-electric cars led a checkered career usually operating on the periphery of the system until 1960 when they were converted to multiple-unit so they could be coupled with other all-electric cars. After that they were used on the Arborway line until they were retired in 1977.\n\nThe PCC cars continued under Metropolitan Transit Authority ownership beginning in 1947 and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ownership beginning in 1964. After 1951, the MTA had a large fleet of 321 PCCs, and the MTA added 25 additional second-hand PCCs in 1958. Pullman-Standard built all of Boston's PCCs except for the first car in 1937.

Some PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes. In the 1920s, St. Louis Public Service operated over 500 miles of track with over 1600 cars. Starting in 1940, St. Louis acquired 300 PCC cars. No. 1726 is one of 100 unusual PCCs acquired by St. Louis Public Service in 1946. They had the door layout of a pre-war car with windows like a post-war car. They had two pedal control, push the left one to go and the right one to stop - unique to St. Louis. St. Louis painted its streetcars in a red, cream and white scheme. The last St. Louis streetcar line closed in 1966.\n\nThe San Francisco Municipal Ry. was an eager participant in the PCC development program. Royalties on PCC car sales were applied to further research and development, but PCC purchases by the Muni were restricted by a law which forbade city agencies from making royalty payments. Using loopholes in the law, Muni was able to buy 40 PCC cars in the 1940s and early 1950s. This left the San Francisco system with over 100 cars dating to before 1920. So, in 1957, the Muni leased 70 PCC cars, including No. 1726, from St. Louis Public Service. The catch was that when the lease expired, Muni couldn't return the cars. In effect they had bought them, which was all well and good with St. Louis which abandoned its final streetcars in 1966. The Muni renumbered No. 1726 to No. 1155. Except for adding a backup pole, re-gauging the cars from St. Louis' 4' 10\" gauge to 4' 8 \u00bd\" standard gauge, and applying their standard green and cream paint job, the Muni did little to alter the St. Louis Public Service cars. San Francisco placed its PCCs in storage after purchasing new Light Rail Vehicles in the early 1980s. San Francisco has since developed a new PCC fleet with second-hand cars acquired from Philadelphia and Newark for its E and F heritage lines. A number of 1155's sister cars remain in storage and may be restored for future route expansion. \n\nIn 1995, Seashore acquired No. 1155 at auction from San Francisco Muni.

At its peak in the 1920s, there were some 750 streetcars and over 300 miles of track, including routes across the state line in Kansas City, KS.

The PCC car takes its name from the Electric Railway Presidents Conference Committee established in the early 1930s to design a modern, streamlined streetcar. It was a successful design with approximately 5000 PCC cars being built between 1936 and 1952 for systems in the U.S. and Canada. Some PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes. No. 764 was part of a 75 car order of all-electric PCCs purchased by the Kansas City Public Service Co. in 1946. The company liked the look of its 1941 PCC order and requested that St. Louis Car Co. build the new cars without standee windows as was then standard. Instead, the Kansas City cars had large picture windows with a blue glass sun shade across the top of each window. These cars initially operated on the Country Club Line and on routes crossing the state line into Kansas. Streetcar operation in Kansas City ended in 1957. \n\nAs streetcar operation in Kansas City wound down in the 1950s, the company sold the 700 series all-electrics to several buyers. In 1955, forty cars, including No. 764, went to the Philadelphia Transportation Company in Philadelphia. Philadelphia re-gauged its cars to 5' 2-1/2\" and repainted them to the PTC's green and cream paint scheme. For years they operated primarily on that city's route 50, an important north-south line. The cars were randomly renumbered into the 2251 - 2290 series in Philadelphia, with No. 764 becoming 2289. . \n\n Trolley Valhalla, a museum group at Tansboro, NJ acquired PTC No. 2289 in 1967. No. 2289 served at the museum's gift shop with an HO layout inside. In 1972, Trolley Valhalla moved to Jobstown, NJ. Trolley Valhalla folded in the mid-1970s, and No. 2289 went to the Geigertown Central Railroad Museum at Geigertown, PA. This was a collection of railroad equipment headed by David Shirey. No. 2289 sat in a field, apparently unused. Seashore acquired the car in 2012. At the same time, Seashore acquired KCPS No. 781 which had gone to Philadelphia as No. 2278. East Penn Valley Traction and later the Electric City Trolley Museum in Scranton, PA had owned No. 2278 after its retirement. Seashore hopes to combine the two cars, each of which is incomplete, into one complete car, which will bear KCPS number 764.

PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes. The Twin City Rapid Transit's PCC cars were several inches wider than the standard in other cities. Under new management starting in 1949, Twin City began converting to buses and selling the new PCC cars. \n\nIn 1953, Public Service Coordinated Transit (a unit of the Public Service Electric & Gas Company) purchased 30 of the Twin City PCC cars, including No. 324, for operation on the Newark City Subway. This 5 mile-long line, which opened in 1935, operated in a subway on the abandoned Morris Canal bed in downtown Newark and on the surface on the city's north side. Public Service renumbered No. 324 to No. 5. The PCC cars began operating on the Newark City Subway on January 8, 1954. Public Service Coordinated Transit was renamed Transport of New Jersey in 1971 but remained owned by PSE&G. New Jersey Transit, a state agency, took over the transit operations of Public Service in 1980. A change in paint scheme accompanied each corporate name change. The PCC cars ran for 48 years on the Newark City Subway until being replaced by LRV vehicles in 2001. When New Jersey Transit modernized its City Subway for LRV operation, it replaced trolley poles with pantographs on the PCC cars. Newark's PCC cars were well maintained and were well regarded by riders and the general public.\n\nAfter being stored for several years, Seashore acquired No. 5 in 2011.

White manufactured buses between the 1930s and 1953. Its best known bus was the model 706 national park bus produced in the 1930s and still in use at Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks. White began producing the 700 series transit buses in 1937. These transit buses had a 12 cylinder, under-floor, \"pancake,\" gasoline engine noted for snappy acceleration. In 1946, White devised an oil clutch and synchronized transmission which made it easier for the driver to shift gears. Transit systems in cities such as Washington, Cleveland, San Francisco and Boston (including the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway) used White transit buses.\n\nBetween 1938 and 1947, the Boston Elevated Railway acquired a fleet of White model 788 buses, numbered between 1500 and 1599. Nos. 1508 and 1509 came in 1946. They filled gaps in the numbering series left vacant after the Office of Defense Transportation had requisitioned the original Nos. 1508 and 1509 during the war. The second Nos. 1508 and 1509 had White's newer transmission design. After the Metropolitan Transit Authority acquired the BERy in 1947, the MTA acquired another 25 White model 788s, numbered 2800 \u2013 2824. No. 1508 spent its entire life based at the Somerville garage where in ran in Somerville and Cambridge. The MTA put No. 1508 into storage in 1963. No. 1508 remained on the property when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority assumed ownership in 1964. The MBTA retired all its remaining White buses in 1966 when its bus fleet became entirely diesel powered.

In 1939, the B&S replaced streetcars with a fleet of five ACF buses. This fleet was inadequate and was expanded during after World War II.\n\nACF-Brill had been formed in a 1944 merger. American Car and Foundry was the country's largest manufacturer of railroad cars and also made streetcars and interurbans. J.G. Brill had been the largest producer of streetcars and had also produced trolley buses and motor buses. In 1922, ACF ventured into the rubber tired arena with the purchase of Carter Carburetor Corporation. ACF targeted the growing motor coach market and began working with J. G. Brill on acquiring control of Hall-Scott Motor Company, maker of gasoline engines and Fageol Motors, a manufacturer of coach bodies. American Car & Foundry Motors was incorporated in 1925 and controlled Hall-Scott and Fageol Motors. In 1926, the holding company, Brill Corporation, was created to acquire the stock of ACF Motors and J. G. Brill. American Car and Foundry owned 65% of Brill Corporation's stock. Although controlled by Brill Corporation, ACF Motors and J.G. Brill were not merged together until 1944 to form the ACF-Brill Motors Company. ACF-Brill produced trolley buses and motor buses. The motor buses used Hall-Scott gasoline engines. ACF-Brill became only the fifth largest bus producer. The C-36 bus was one of ACF-Brill's primary models. ACF-Brill sold 1,546 C-36 buses. In the 1950s, General Motors diesel engine buses took over most of the bus market, and ACF-Brill closed in 1954. Under an agreement with ACF-Brill, Canadian Car & Foundry also built almost 1,000 Model C-36 buses for operators in Canada, ending production in 1955. \n\nACF-Brill built this Model C-36 bus in 1947 for Lynnfield Community Bus Lines in Lynnfield, MA as their No. 32. Lynnfield Community operated a route between Wakefield and Lynnfield, MA that had previously been operated by Boston & Maine Transportation. The Boston Elevated Railway and several other suburban Boston operators also purchased fleets of A.C.F.-Brill Model C-36 buses, making this a common vehicle in the Boston area after World War II.\n\nIn 1949, as part of its effort to expand capacity, Biddeford & Saco Railroad acquired Lynnfield No. 32 where it became B&S No. 25. In 1955, the company changed its name to Biddeford and Saco Bus Lines. The B&S was the last transit company in the U.S. with a 5 cent basic fare until the B&S raised its fare to 10 cents in 1956. In later years, the B&S used No. 31 in school bus service, painted yellow. It also provided shuttle service for an Association of Railway Museums conference at Seashore. In 1972, the B&S renumbered No. 25 to No. 31, taking the spot of two, previously retired Nos. 31. \n\nIn 1977, the B&S donated No. 31 to Seashore where it joined the museum's first vehicle, Biddeford & Saco Railroad streetcar No. 31. The B&S had used Maine commercial bus license plates Nos. 1 -8. B&S President Richard Stride agreed to give Seashore bus license plate 1. Mike Lennon and others went to the B&S to get the plates. The museum registered the plates with Maine motor vehicle and used them on bus No. 31. The most recently registered plates are for the year 2014. In the more recent years, VIP Bus has registered Maine bus license plate 1.\n\nIn 1978, a movie company used No. 31 in The Brinks Job, about the 1950 Brinks robbery in Boston. To prepare for the movie, Seashore member Mike Lennon drove No. 31 to the Manchester (NH) Transit Authority's garage for repainting. Lennon grit blasted the yellow paint from the bus, and No. 31 was repainted in Boston's Metropolitan Transit Authority colors. For the movie, No. 31 appeared as No. 2502. Afterwards, No. 31 was repainted back into the earlier B&S blue and cream colors. (The blue is 1946 Oldsmobile blue.) While in Manchester, No. 31 appeared in the local Thanksgiving parade down Elm Street with Lennon at the wheel. No. 31 also ran on a Boston Street Railway Association fan trip which ended when the engine overheated. \n\nIn 1980-81, Seashore did restoration work on No. 31. In 1989, No. 31 went to Quebec for a provincial exposition.

Mack produced a total of 7095 Model C buses in different varieties between 1945 and 1960. The Mack model C buses had heavy frames giving them a reputation for being tough and durable. However, compared with competing General Motors buses, the Macks required a larger engine which made them more expensive to operate.

(In Cleveland, as in Boston, these vehicles were normally termed \"trackless trolleys,\" while elsewhere \"trolley bus\" was a more common designation.) In 1942, the city-owned Cleveland Transit System took over the city's transit operations from the Cleveland Railway. Cleveland did not establish more trolley bus routes until after World War II. After the war, the Cleveland Transit System planned to convert many, but not all, of its streetcar lines to electric trolley bus operation. In 1946, CTS ordered 175 trolley coaches from St. Louis Car Company. Of these, St. Louis delivered Nos. 1000 \u2013 1074 in 1947, while the remaining 100 coaches came in 1948. St. Louis had been a major streetcar manufacturer and was also an early trolley bus producer. St. Louis Car became one of the major trolley bus manufacturers, delivering over 1100 coaches to 15 cities between 1930 and 1952. Streetcar service in Cleveland ended in 1954. By the 1950s, Cleveland Transit became one of the larger trolley bus operators in the country with 461 trolley coaches on 15 routes. CTS began phasing out trolley bus operation in 1958 in connection with expansion of its rapid transit service. CTS ended trolley bus operation in 1963. CTS sold some its coaches to Mexico City and Toronto; all the rest were sold for scrap. \n\nIn 1963, J. Ours purchased No. 1052 and moved it to New Brighton, PA. Instead of being scrapped, the seats were removed, and the vehicle was used for storage. By 1983, No. 1052 had moved to A.& B. Salvage Co. in Lancaster Twp., PA. Greg Walz of the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum spotted it and informed Bob Humanchuk of the Northern Ohio Railway Museum. Humanchuk inspected No. 1052, found it sound and obtained it. He then donated it to the Seashore Trolley Museum. Seashore volunteers also obtained other Cleveland bus and trolley bus parts from the A. & B. scrap yard. In 1991, Seashore volunteer Fred Maloney repainted the coach in its Cleveland Transit colors of two-tone beige. No. 1052 is Seashore's only trolley bus built by St. Louis Car. No. 1052 became part of a growing collection of Cleveland transit vehicles at Seashore. The Museum had previously acquired Cleveland streetcar No. 1227, streetcar trailer car No. 2318 and Lake Shore Electric interurban No. 117. Then, in 2009, Seashore acquired Cleveland rapid transit car No. 113 and another trailer car No. 2365 which replaced No. 2318 in the collection. The museum now had all four types of electric transit vehicles from Cleveland: streetcar, interurban, rapid transit and trolley bus.

The PCC car takes its name from the Electric Railway Presidents Conference established in the early 1930s to design a modern, streamlined streetcar. It was a successful design with approximately 5000 PCC cars being built between 1936 and 1952 for systems in the U.S. and Canada. PCC cars built after World War II used the all-electric variation having electric brakes instead of the earlier air-operated brakes. No. 2709 is one of 200 all-electric PCCs built by St. Louis Car for PTC in 1947 to replace older, standard streetcars. This group of PCCs is one of approximately 1500 similar streetcars built by St. Louis Car from 1947 to 1952 and sold to various streetcar operators. Another 500 relatively similar PCC cars were produced by Pullman-Standard for several systems, including Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority No. 3221 which is also at Seashore. However, No. 2709 is an unusual PCC car because it was built for two-man operation. Traffic density on several Philadelphia lines operated with PCCs was so heavy that two-man crews were needed during rush hours, and one line required such operation all day. Thus, the final order for new PCC cars placed by the Philadelphia Transportation Co. was split three ways. There were 90 cars without conductor's stands (2096-2185), 30 cars without motorman's fare box brackets (2701-2730), and 80 cars with both (2731-2810). The 30 cars equipped for two-man operation only were used for base service on Route 23, the system's longest and busiest line stretching from Germantown in the city's far northwest, through North Philadelphia and Center City almost to the Navy Yard in the south. No portion of the line had light traffic, and transfers were available to almost every other streetcar or bus line in the city, as well as the Broad Street Subway. With this level of service, the company had no qualms about a 30 car fleet of its most modern cars being dedicated to the line.\n\nAs traffic declined, the PTC eventually converted these cars for one-man operation, and they soldiered on into the 1990s, serving other lines as the demands of Route 23 dropped. In 1968, the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (a state agency) acquired the PTC. SEPTA repainted the streetcars from PTC's green and cream colors to SEPTA's white with a blue and red stripe. No. 2709 went through a major overhaul in the 1980s. The inability of SEPTA to purchase replacement cars, finally turned Route 23 and its east-west neighbor, Route 56 into permanent bus lines, and SEPTA retired its PCC cars. In 2002-4, SEPTA rebuilt 18 of its stored PCC cars for operation on Route 15 (Girard Ave.). \n\nSeashore purchased No. 2709 from SEPTA in 1994. The car was in excellent, operating condition. Like a few other cities, Philadelphia used a streetcar track gauge that was wider than the standard 4' 8 \u00bd.\" Philadelphia's gauge was 5' 2 \u00bc.\" To convert No. 2709 to the museum's standard gauge, Seashore replaced the wheels and axles with components from a Boston streetcar. In 2009, Seashore replaced one motor on No. 2709.

Twin Coach was formed by the Fageol brothers in 1927, and was a major motor bus and trolley bus producer until Flxible acquired Twin's bus manufacturing business in 1955. While the first articulated trolley bus was built in Italy in 1939, Twin Coach pioneered articulated trolley buses and motor buses in North America in 1940. These were the first rubber tired vehicles that could carry as many passengers as a large streetcar. Twin's first articulated vehicles were two 3-axle vehicles built as demonstrators. One was an electric trolley bus eventually purchased by the Cleveland Transit System. The other was an articulated motor bus later bought by the Chicago Transit Authority and converted to electric. This is now at the Illinois Railway Museum. The only fleet purchase of the Super Twin articulated motor bus was 15 vehicles, including No. 1312, for Omaha in 1947. These Super Twins had dual engines (the origin of the Twin Coach Company name) powered by propane. These 60-foot long buses did not bend sideways, but they bent vertically so that all wheels stayed on the road when going up and down hills. A synchronous steering system caused wheels to steer at both front and back of the bus. In Omaha, the Super Twins ran in rush-hour service on principal routes. One unit could replace two smaller buses. The Super Twins could move more people and lower cost and potentially reduce traffic congestion. Nevertheless, other transit operators did not acquire the model. Twin's articulated buses were precursors for articulated buses that became popular starting in the 1980s. \n\nWhen Omaha streetcar service ended in 1952, Omaha Traction and the Omaha & Council Bluffs Street Railway became the Omaha Transit Company. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 1312 in 2006 and placed it on static display near the Highwood carbarn.", "additional_images": []}, "246": {"technical_information": {"seats": "36", "engine": "Hall-Scott 135", "tires": "11.00 x 20", "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "30' 9.00\"", "width": "95.00\"", "height": "9' 6.00\""}}, "title": "Middlesex & Boston St. Ry. 192", "source": "Massachusetts", "source_city": "Massachusetts", "source_state": "USA", "img_alt": "", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "", "builder": "ACF-Brill", "description": "1948 ACF-Brill", "category": "Motor Buses", "year": "1948", "retired_from_service": "1965", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1989", "note": "No. 192 is stored inside Central carbarn.

The MTA ordered 25 trolley buses from Pullman-Standard that year and another 128 identical trolley buses (Nos. 8355 \u2013 8482) in 1948. This was a standard Pullman post-war model used in many U.S. cities. In the period before and after World War II, Pullman-Standard was the largest American manufacturer of trolley buses. With its plant in nearby Worcester, MA, Pullman produced almost all of Boston's trolley buses. At the peak of Boston's trolley bus operation in 1952, the MTA had 463 of the vehicles, making it the third largest trolley bus system in the U.S., after Chicago and Atlanta.\n\nThe MTA's trolley bus acquisitions in 1947 and 1948 were primarily to replace streetcars in the Dorchester and Roxbury districts. No. 8361 entered service at the beginning of 1949 at the Park Street car house at Field's Corner. The MTA paint scheme included a gray roof, cream window area and orange side and end panels. The MTA later moved No. 8361 to the Clarendon Hill and Eagle Street car houses. No. 8361 had a relatively short life. It went into storage in 1962 as the MTA converted routes to motor buses. By 1964, four trolley bus routes remained because a tunnel at Cambridge restricted operation of motor buses there. The Cambridge trolley bus operation has survived, with new vehicles in 1976 and then in 2004.

White manufactured buses between the 1930s and 1953. Its best known bus was the model 706 national park bus produced in the 1930s and still in use at Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks. White began producing the 700 series transit buses in 1937. These transit buses had a 12 cylinder, under-floor, \"pancake,\" gasoline engine noted for snappy acceleration. This design means that White engines should be serviced from a pit, and the engines were considered to be intricate. In 1946, White devised an oil clutch and synchronized transmission which made it easier for the driver to shift gears. Transit systems in cities such as Washington, Cleveland, San Francisco and Boston (including the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway) used White transit buses.\n\nBetween 1938 and 1947, the Boston Elevated Railway acquired a fleet of White model 788 buses, numbered between 1500 and 1599. After the Metropolitan Transit Authority acquired the BERy in 1947, the MTA acquired another 25 White model 788s, numbered 2800 \u2013 2824. Although the 2800s had the same model number as the 1500s, the 2800s featured an improved engine and a better underframe. At various times, No. 2824 operated out of the Somerville, Fellsway, Albany Street and Arborway garages. The MTA put No. 2824 into storage in 1963. No. 2824 remained on the property when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority assumed ownership in 1964. The MBTA retired all its remaining White buses in 1966 when its bus fleet became entirely diesel powered. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 2824 in 1968.", "additional_images": []}, "250": {"technical_information": {"seats": "37", "engine": "Detroit Diesel 4-71 inline", "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "35'", "width": "96.00\""}}, "title": "Boston & Maine Transportation Co. 784", "source": "Massachusetts", "source_city": "Massachusetts", "source_state": "USA", "img_alt": "Blue Bus", "img_attribute": "Matthew D.

This model featured a rounded rear end, a sunken aisle, reclining seats, baggage racks and under floor luggage bins.\n\nStarting in the 1920s, steam railroads and electric interurban lines operated buses to supplement or replace passenger rail service. The Boston & Maine Railroad was an early bus operator. In 1924, it formed a subsidiary, Boston & Maine Transportation Company (B&MT), to operate its buses. B&MT expanded through northern New England, partly by acquiring former trolley routes as well as replacing or adding to Boston & Maine Railroad passenger train service. In 1949, B&MT purchased five PDA-3703 coaches, Nos. 782-786. These were among 17 similar PDA coaches that B&MT acquired between 1947 and 1949. No. 784 is believed to have operated on most of B&MT's main routes. The busiest route was between Boston and Portland via Kennebunk, ME. No. 784 carried a stylish \"speed stripe\" olive green and cream paint scheme with red stripes, silver side bands and an illuminated sign on the rear.\n\nDuring the 1950s, growing automobile use caused B&MT shrunk its operations. In early 1957 it sold its Lawrence, MA \u2013 Manchester, NH route to Trombly Motor Coach, along with No. 784 and three other buses. No. 784 became Trombly No. 84 and then No. 158 in 1959. The bus ran on the Lawrence - Manchester route as well as in charter service. In 1961, after a fatal accident where a Trombly bus collided with a tractor trailer truck, Trombly went bankrupt and sold its bus fleet. The former No. 784 went to Michaud Bus Lines of Salem, MA where it briefly operated in charter service, still as No. 158. After a year, it went back to Trombly which resumed charter service, but without using ex-784. In 1964, W&W Bus Lines of Antrim, NH acquired the former No. 784, numbering it No. 1, their only bus. It operated for a total of three weeks between Hillsboro, NH and Rockingham Race Track. In 1966, Dublin Christian Academy of Dublin, NH acquired the bus to provide transportation for school events including twice-annual trips to South Carolina with the school's choir. About 1978, Loring Lawrence, of Manchester, NH, acquired the coach. Lawrence is Editor-in-Chief of Bus History Magazine published by the Bus History Association. He operated No. 784 locally and had the Manchester Transit Authority overhaul the engine. \n\nIn 1999, Loring Lawrence donated No. 784 to Seashore.

It is in fair condition and in need of various repairs.", "fund": "693", "car_id": "252", "history": "After World War II, Nova Scotia Light & Power (NSL&P), which ran the transit system in Halifax, decided to convert its entire streetcar system to trolley bus operation. These vehicles can also be termed \"trackless trolleys\" or \"trolleycoaches\" which was the term used in Halifax. Trolley buses have some advantages as transit vehicles. They can accelerate and brake better than motor buses, and they have no exhaust and are almost silent. They are the best transit vehicles (aside from cable cars) for climbing and descending steep hills. A downside for trolley buses is their two overhead wires (thought by some to be unsightly) which are required to complete the electric circuit unlike streetcars which use rails for the return current. More importantly, until the 1990s, trolley buses were restricted to streets with the overhead wires. Since then, all newly manufactured trolley buses are equipped with auxiliary battery power which allows them to bypass streets undergoing construction and to extend service beyond the end point of the overhead wires. In the 1950s and 1960s, most North American transit operators replaced trolley bus routes with more versatile motor buses. \n\nNSL&P had considered modernizing the street railway, but important negatives were the narrow streets and sharp turns \u2013 the very reason that its entire fleet was limited to 82 short wheelbase, 4-wheel Birney trolleys. Following a detailed analysis of future trends, a Toronto consultant advised trolleycoaches as the best solution to handle an expected 50 percent increase in patronage. The carefully-crafted conversion took place over a four-month period between March and July of 1949. Installation of the new trolleycoach wires was initially concentrated in downtown Halifax and Barrington Street, resulting in trolleycoaches working the city center portion of most routes while the Birney trolleys continued to temporarily work the outer portions. The final streetcar journeys took place on March 26, 1949, and in so doing, Halifax became the first city in North America whose transit system was exclusively trolleycoach \u2013 with not a single auxiliary motor bus.\n\nThe initial trolleycoach fleet comprised 71 Canadian Car & Foundry (CCF) 44-seat model T44 coaches shipped aboard railroad flatcars from the CCF plant in Fort William (now Thunder Bay), Ontario. Numbered 201-271, all had arrived in Halifax by early 1949. Additional purchases brought four T-44A's in 1950 (272-275) and two more in 1952 (276 and 277). Another four were required in 1954 (278-281) due to the opening of the new cross-harbor Angus MacDonald suspension bridge to Dartmouth. Anticipating continued growth in patronage, these were followed in 1955 by the surprising purchase of six 1947 Pullman-Standard 44CS trolleycoaches from United Transit Co. of Providence, Rhode Island. Because Halifax is concentrated on a peninsula with only a narrow connection to the mainland, trolleycoaches were well suited to serve the dense housing and commercial areas. With few changes, ten trolleycoach routes with frequent headways continued to serve Halifax for two decades.\n\nAltogether, between 1946 and 1954, CC&F \u2013 later known as Can Car \u2013 built 1,114 trolley buses for Canadian operators, following designs licensed by American Car & Foundry (ACF-Brill.)\n\nIn 1963, Nova Scotia Light & Power bought a dozen Canadian-built GM TDH4519 diesel buses which were assigned solely to a pair of entirely new routes, the 8 and 10, largely serving new residential neighborhoods and shopping centers. However, during the 1960s, deficits, small at first, increased every year rising to $105,097 in 1965. And by then, serious traffic congestion was hindering and delaying trolleycoach service. With nearly all land on the Halifax peninsula occupied, housing tracts began to appear in neighboring communities, resulting in their annexation into the City of Halifax. Terms of its franchise required NSL&P to serve the entire city, creating an impossible problem for trolleyoach operation. The situation led to the formation of a city-owned transit commission \u2013 Halifax Transit. With an entirely new fleet of diesel buses (and the twelve diesel buses ex-NSL&P), the new regime took over on January 1, 1970. The last trolleycoach, No. 243, pulled into the Young Street garage at 12:43 AM on New Year's Day \u2013 the final goodbye to a highly respected and well managed trolleycoach transit system.\n\nAfter the municipal takeover, Nova Scotia Light & Power sought buyers for its newly idle trolley buses. All were scrapped aside from No. 273 and a few sold to individuals for use as cabins and storage sheds. In response to a request from Seashore, NSL&P donated trolleycoach No. 273 to the museum. This was the only Halifax trolleycoach to be preserved. No. 273 became part of the museum's extensive collection of Canadian transit vehicles \u2013 the largest outside of Canada. Within Seashore's Canadian collection, No. 273 is the only representative from the Maritime Provinces.\n\nIn 1971, No. 273's trip to the museum started by truck from Halifax to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. From Yarmouth to Portland, ME, No. 273 rode on the ferry MS Prince of Fundy. The ship's owner, Lion Ferry, donated the transportation on the ferry. From Portland, a Biddeford & Saco Bus crew towed No. 273 to Kennebunkport. \n\nNo. 273 was the fourth trolley bus at Seashore, and was an impetus for the museum to construct overhead wires to operate these vehicles.", "additional_images": []}, "253": {"technical_information": {"seats": "48", "engine": "Detroit Diesel 6-71 inline", "tires": "11.00 x 20", "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "39' 10.00\"", "width": "102.00\"", "height": "9' 8.50\""}}, "title": "Greater Portland Transit District 504", "source": "Portland, Maine", "source_city": "Portland", "source_state": "Maine", "img_alt": "Green 504 Bus", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00504BME-20020413.jpg", "builder": "General Motors Corp.", "description": "1950 General Motors Corp.", "category": "Motor Buses", "year": "1950", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1978", "fund": "818", "car_id": "253", "additional_images": [], "history": ""}, "330": {"technical_information": {"seats": "44", "engine": "Detroit Diesel", "tires": "11x20", "motor": {"manufacturer": "Detroit Diesel", "model": "6-71"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "35'", "width": "96.00\"", "height": "9' 8.50\""}}, "title": "Portland METRO 310", "source": "Portland, Maine", "source_city": "Portland", "source_state": "Maine", "img_alt": "", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "", "builder": "GMC", "description": "1950 GMC", "category": "Motor Buses", "year": "1950", "acquired_by_the_museum": "2006", "car_id": "330", "additional_images": [], "history": ""}, "254": {"technical_information": {"seats": "44", "control": "MRC", "brakes": "Straight Air", "compressor": "DH-10", "tires": "11x22", "motor": {"number": "1", "manufacturer": "General Electric", "model": "1213"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "40'", "width": "8' 6.00\"", "height": "10' 9.00\"", "weight": "21350 lbs."}}, "title": "Metropolitan Transit Authority 8490", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "08490TMA.jpg", "builder": "Pullman-Standard Car Co.", "description": "1951 Pullman-Standard Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Trackless Trolleys", "year": "1951", "retired_from_service": "1976", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1976", "fund": "558", "car_id": "254", "history": "Coach 8430 is one of 90 of a newer model built in 1951, of which 30, including No. 8490, were delivered with left side doors for loading at the island platforms at Forest Hills station.

Seashore has acquired representatives of each type of Boston PCC: Pre-war style (No. 3019), wartime with a flat roof (No. 3127), wartime with raised roof (No. 3083), Post-war with standee windows (No. 3221), Post-war with picture windows (Nos. 3274 and 3292), and double-ended (No. 3340).", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green trolley 3292 historic photo", "img_src": "735-ZHuGYnzYPHqIppMX9v85dKh5bU21NOiw2yyLC80uqPFS7CYj87nTG6Kp42bh.jpg", "img_attribution": "In Boston in Aug. 1966 by Jerry Appleman at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "258": {"technical_information": {"seats": "44", "control": "XDA1B (C-1)", "brakes": "SMEE", "compressor": "A-1", "trucks": {"number": "2", "manufacturer": "General Steel", "model": "#4"}, "motor": {"number": "4", "manufacturer": "Westinghouse", "model": "1432H"}, "weight_and_dimensions": {"length": "48'", "width": "8' 6.00\"", "weight": "47700 lbs."}}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 0559 and 0562", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Boston Blue Line Subway", "img_attribute": "", "img_src": "00559RMA.jpg", "builder": "St. Louis Car Co.", "description": "1951 St. Louis Car Co.", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Rapid Transit Cars", "year": "1951", "retired_from_service": "1985", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1985", "fund": "561", "sponsormanager": "None", "car_id": "258", "history": "In 1951, Boston's Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) acquired 40 cars (Nos. 0548 - 0587) to equip the Revere Extension of the former Boston Elevated Railway's East Boston rapid transit line. (All Boston rapid transit cars have a \"0\" in front of their numbers to distinguish them from streetcars.) The 1951 cars were termed No. 3 East Boston cars, which supplemented the No. 1 and No. 2 East Boston cars built in 1923 and 1924. The MTA purchased the No. 3 East Boston cars from St. Louis Car Company, unlike other postwar Boston rapid transit cars that came from Pullman. The No. 3 cars were an innovative design of the Transit Research Corporation based on PCC principles, and they are the only examples of TRC's Design \"B\". As such, they had TRC B-10 trucks specifically designed for PCC rapid transit applications. The No. 3 cars were the first rapid transit cars with extensive use of \"maintenance-free\" interior materials including formica, stainless steel, etc. They were also the first rapid transit cars with rubber-cushioned draft gear and composition brake shoes. \n\nThe MTA painted the East Boston cars two-tone gray with an orange stripe. The MTA extended the line to Wonderland in 1954, using the former Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad right-of-way. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority acquired the MTA in 1964. The MBTA adopted a color coding scheme to identify Boston's various transit lines; the line to Wonderland became the Blue Line. So, the MBTA painted the cars blue and white replacing the former gray. A major cracking problem arose in the cars' B-10 trucks, requiring their complete replacement with the General Steel 70 model in the early 1960s. In 1979, new cars, known as \"Bluebells,\" began to replace the No. 3 East Boston cars as well as the venerable No. 1 and No. 2 East Boston cars. \n\nAfter several years in storage, Nos. 0559 came to Seashore in 1985, and No. 0562 came in 1965. Although the two cars are mated together, they have never operated together as a pair. The museum replaced broken windows on the cars, but the cars have not been equipped with poles for operation at the museum. A cursory inspection in 2012 indicated that the arc chutes on many contactors have deteriorated and must be replaced. Besides Nos. 0559 and 0562, Seashore also owns older and newer East Boston Blue Line cars. In 1982, Seashore acquired No. 1 cars Nos. 0512 and 0513 and No. 2 cars 0546 and 0547.

So, between 1950 and 1959, St. Louis Car Co. built a large fleet of 720 cars, Nos. 6001 \u2013 6720. These were built in semi-permanently coupled pairs with an operator's position at just the outside ends of each pair. The \"A\" car of each pair seats 47 passengers and has a conductor's position with door controls at the car's rear, while the \"B\" car lacks the conductor's position and seats 51. The \"married pair\" concept gave economies from fewer operator and conductor positions compared with traditional double-ended cars. The 6000 series cars enabled the CTA to retire its last wooden elevated cars. During the 1950s, the CTA retired its fleet of 600 PCC streetcars that had been built in 1947-48. St. Louis Car recycled the PCC trucks and electrical equipment for reuse in Nos. 6201 - 6720. The entire class used all-electric PCC technology \u2013 its first application beyond surface streetcars. Although the cars have steel frames, the upper part of the bodies are made of aluminum, reducing the effects of rust and salt. The 6000 series cars were sometimes called \"Spam Cans\" because of their rather boxy metal construction. The cars were painted in the CTA's mercury green and cream paint scheme with an orange stripe. In 1965, The CTA adopted a mint green and white scheme. The 6000 series cars formed the backbone of Chicago's rapid transit fleet through the 1970s. The 6000s ran on almost all of the CTA rapid transit lines and were particularly identified with the busy North-South elevated and subway line. \n\nTo commemorate the formal retirement of the 6000 series cars, the CTA conducted two events. On Nov. 29, 1992, the Ravenswood line's entire Sunday service was operated by three two-car train sets, one of which was Nos. 6599-6600. Then, the final regular service trip for the 6000s was a six-car train on Dec. 4, 1992 including Nos. 6599-6600. The last run for Nos. 6599 and 6600 was on October 24, 1993 as part of a fan trip on Chicago's new Midway line.\n\nNos. 6599 and 6600 came to Seashore in 1994. This gave Seashore the only collection of cars from all four of America's traditional rapid transit systems. The cars have acquired a somewhat shabby look due to weathering and the tendency of aluminum to shed paint. No effort has been made to improve their appearance or make them operational. Other 6000 series cars are at the Fox River Trolley Museum, the Illinois Railway Museum and the Smithsonian Institution.

The new cars were somewhat along the lines of the 1951 East Boston Tunnel cars (0559 and 0562), but, to get a wider body with tight platform clearances, they had curved sides somewhat like the famous products of the long gone Cincinnati Car Company. these cars were the very last turned out by Pullman-Standard at the old Osgood Bradley plant in Worcester, and so ended that firm's history as an electric car builder.

In 1955, the city-owned Cleveland Transit System opened the first all-new rapid transit line in the U. S. since the 1920s. The \"Rapid\" line initially ran between Windermere, on Cleveland's East Side, and Cleveland Union Terminal. The original CTS rapid transit cars were called \"Bluebirds\" because of their blue and silver paint scheme. Clevelanders sometimes less-fondly called them \"Spam Cans.\" Cleveland figured that off peak riding would be light and therefore provided for single car operation. The original fleet consisted of 56 cars operated in pairs and 13 cars (numbers 100-112) operated as single cars. In 1958, CTS extended the line to West Park and purchased another 14 paired cars and six singles (numbers 113-118). The single cars were no longer than the cars designed for the elevated lines in Boston and Chicago, but were 10' 4\" wide, comparable with the most modern lines in those cities. The \"Bluebirds\" were almost identical to the cars built by St. Louis Car for Boston's Blue Line in 1951. The cars collected power through roof mounted pantographs. Like the 1951 Boston cars and the Chicago 1958 cars, St. Louis Car used PCC technology to a great extent in the Cleveland cars. \n\nCTS continued to extend its rapid transit line west, reaching Cleveland Hopkins Airport in 1968. Cleveland became the first U.S. city to connect its airport to downtown with rail rapid transit. With the airport expansion, the CTS purchased longer, \"Airporter\" cars and relegated the Bluebirds to just rush hour service. In 1975, the Cleveland Transit System was expanded to include suburban bus lines and became the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA). The RTA fully retired the Bluebird cars in 1985 in favor of new equipment. \n\nThe Gerald E. Brookins Museum of Electric Railways (known as Trolleyville, U.S.A.), a museum in Ohio, acquired No. 113 when Cleveland retired the car. Trolleyville U.S.A. closed down in 2005 and put its collection of 31 vehicles into storage. Seashore acquired No. 113 when the Trolleyville collection was auctioned off in 2009. In the same auction, Seashore acquired Cleveland Railways trailer car No. 2365. No. 113 joined the similar Boston Blue Line cars Nos. 0559 and 0562 already at Seashore.

Nos. 1 \u2013 4 could easily operate at 60 \u2013 65 miles per hour. The CTA painted Nos. 1 \u2013 4 in a distinctive maroon and silver gray scheme.

By 1964, the CTA repainted the cars in its standard green and cream scheme.\n\nIn 1964, Nos. 1 \u2013 4 were the initial cars assigned to the CTA's new Skokie Swift service. The Skokie Swift (now named the Yellow Line) was a 5-mile non-stop route from Howard Street on Chicago's northern border to Dempster Street in Skokie. This line used the recently abandoned track of the Chicago North Shore & Milwaukee interurban. Most of the route used overhead wire requiring a transition from third rail to overhead wire at speed. For this, the CTA custom designed \"pan trolleys\" for Nos. 1 \u2013 4. In the early 1970s, the CTA converted No. 1 to chopper control. The Skokie Swift schedule called for an average start-to-stop speed of 46 mph which the CTA advertised as \"the world's fastest rapid transit.\" The Skokie Swift service soon attracted more patronage than expected, and the CTA added more cars to the service. Funds from the federal Mass Transit Demonstration Program helped finance starting the Skokie Swift. The success of the Skokie Swift helped pave the way for future federal funding of mass transit. \n\nIn 1974, General Electric acquired No. 1 to use at its Erie, PA plant for testing new equipment. Before sending No. 1 to GE, the CTA repainted the car in a silver and charcoal scheme. The CTA scrapped Nos. 2 -4 in 1974-75. In the mid-1980s, GE put No. 1 into storage. \n\nAfter having been derelict at Erie for many years, General Electric donated No. 1 to Seashore in 2016.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Chicago Elevated Car 1", "img_src": "773-Chr1DqRKlXi0DBHyvXDrR0I4WeBhuHsuwIyMcEwOKox69V5qMXzKUBxS7CFn.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

Brantford fully converted from streetcars to buses in 1939. Between 1954 and 1966, Brantford acquired 19 General Motors Corp. TGH-3102 buses with various roster numbers between 540 and 662. GMC delivered No. 627 in 1962 \n\nYellow Coach introduced the streamlined \"Old Look\" bus design 1940. General Motors acquired Yellow Coach in 1943 and continued the model. About 38,000 \"Old Look\" buses were built between 1940 and 1969. Most had diesel engines and were used to replace older gasoline buses. \"Old Look\" buses came in numerous versions and ranged between 25 feet and 41 feet in length. Model TGH-3102 refers to Transit, Gasoline engine, Hydraulic transmission and 31 passengers. This model is has a relatively short length of 28 feet. \n\nAbout 1970, Brantford changed its bus paint scheme from red and white to cream with a red stripe. As Brantford grew, the small size of the TGH-3102 buses was a handicap, and diesel engines became favored over gasoline engines. No. 627 was retired relatively early but after receiving the new paint scheme.\n\nAbout 1970, John Wolfe, of Greenland, New Hampshire, purchased No. 627. Wolfe operated New Hampshire Motor Coach, a small business trading in used buses. Wolfe kept No. 627 at his storage building and drove it on small trips around his area. In 1990, Wolfe closed his business and donated No. 627 to Seashore.\n\nSeashore acquired No. 627 because its small size and classic design were considered suitable for publicity trips outside the museum. In 1991, Seashore repainted the bus back to its original red and white colors. The bus received other repairs during the 1990s. In 1995-98, Seashore operated No. 627 in parades in Biddeford and Kennebunkport. In 1998, No. 627 provided shuttle service to the Home, Food and Craft show at Kennebunk High School from a parking lot on Route 1.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red Bus", "img_src": "00627BON-20020810-01.jpg", "img_attribution": "Matthew D.

Pullman delivered the cars, Nos. 01400-01491, in 1963. (In Boston, rapid transit car numbers all started with zero to distinguish them from surface streetcars.) The 01400s went into service on May 3, 1963. The 01400 series cars, designated Cambridge-Dorchester number 5s, replaced original Cambridge-Dorchester cars dating to 1911 as well as the #4 Cambridge-Dorchester cars (Nos. 0695-0754) dating from 1928. (Seashore has five of the #4 cars, including three that are held for parts.) The design of the 01400 cars was similar to the 01100 series cars built in 1957 for the Main Line (Orange Line). The cars carried a blue, white and gold paint scheme based on the colors of the Massachusetts Commonwealth flag. In common with many other rapid transit cars, the number 5s were built and operated in pairs. The \"A\" car had the motor generator set and storage battery while the \"B\" car had the air compressor for the air brakes. \n\nThe MTA ordered the number 5s with some modern features but also endeavored to keep construction cost down. At 69 \u00bd feet, the 01400s were the longest rapid transit cars in the U.S. when built. They had curved sides which provided wider aisle space. The 01400s had space inside the car for the guard who controlled the doors, unlike on the number 4s where the guard stood on the car platform. The #5s lacked air conditioning and were built of Cor-Ten steel rather than more costly aluminum or stainless steel. These were the last Boston rapid transit cars built without air conditioning. Interior surfaces were plastic which did not require paint. The cars were considered rough riding and noisy. Top speed was 55 mph.\n\nIn 1964, shortly after the arrival of the #5s, the MTA was absorbed into the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). MBTA adopted a color coding scheme to identify Boston's various transit lines. The Cambridge-Dorchester line became the Red Line because the line's northern terminal was at Harvard University whose official color is crimson. However, the #5s did not receive their red paint scheme until the early1980s when the MBTA extended the Red Line to Alewife. In 1994, the MBTA retired the 01400 cars and replaced them with the 01800 series cars built by Bombardier. The MBTA kept four 01400s for work train service and sent two to Seashore. The rest were scrapped. \n\nIn 1995, the MBTA agreed to sell Nos. 01450 and 01455 to Seashore for $1 each. At the time, the museum intended to restore one car to its original blue, white and gold colors and restore the other to its later red colors. No. 01450 is an \"A\" car with the battery, and No. 01455 is a \"B\" car with an air compressor. In 2017, Seashore installed trolley poles so they could operate on museum trackage.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Red subway train -Interior", "img_src": "432-1SlSjh3USLNd1vUzB7wgQVB2NMmXJnBSnQdlQvmzF5XojY0mVYqoAwZmiglj.jpg", "img_attribution": "Phil Tsihilis in Summer of 2021"}, {"img_alt": "Red subway train -Interior", "img_src": "433-tcZR0HUJbe4jMk2is0px61LO73nLix1B61fResPkKApwP4Dkbl349XjwWp81.jpg", "img_attribution": "Phil Tsihilis in Summer of 2021"}, {"img_alt": "Red subway train -Station Listing", "img_src": "434-iDPupQ5ou06C7joShCFY2IRnLhiGyKbt1swMUw4EGnRqe8Nn7T19FCDmWg8C.jpg", "img_attribution": "Phil Tsihilis in Summer of 2021"}, {"img_alt": "Red subway train -Controls", "img_src": "435-Ya8vlxPqKH81cXrj1UE5TbFv1OmZnBbjJmi5PON0cmD7JWDbIdC4FZoGKzQL.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

Transit system. Metro had been formed in 1967 to build a subway system. The bus operations acquired in 1973 became known as Metrobus. In the early 1980s, No. 6481 was among a group of buses leased to New York City during a shortage of equipment. In 1983 the 6400 series buses along with some other Metrobus \"New Look\" coaches were rebuilt by the Blitz Bus and Truck Company of Chicago.

The Transit Authority designed the \"World's Fair Cars\" with large picture windows and a distinctive white and turquoise blue paint scheme. Car #9327 continued operating on the Flushing line for its entire service life. In the 1980s, this car received the red, Teflon-coated paint scheme. Over 1400 New York subway cars, known as \"Redbirds,\" received this paint as part of a successful effort to combat graffiti. In 2000, the baseball World Series was a match between the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. Because the home stadiums of both teams were served by New York subway lines, this was popularly called a \"subway series\" \u2013 the first since 1956.

The R-36WF cars had the white and turquoise \"World's Fair\" paint scheme, but were built as married pairs. So, the Transit Authority usually coupled #9327 or another R-33s car to ten R-36WF cars to make an eleven car train.\n\nCar #9327 received a silver and blue paint scheme in the 1970s and then a white paint scheme in the early 1980s before its red paint scheme.

UMass acquired a group of used buses as well as G.M.C. \"New Look\" bus No. M47. Buses were numbered in a system that included trucks and autos. This began the era of political types taking over the higher posts at the University.\n\nNew buses were to be 30 feet long as the pay rate was much cheaper than larger buses. M47 was the first. Small school buses completed the fleet. The larger used buses and sometimes #M47 were used also for charters. In 1973 a 10-bus fleet of Highway Products TC 31 buses arrived, and along with #M47, provided student transportation until 1974.\n\nPioneer Valley Transportation Authority was formed in 1974. After the horror that was the MBTA with political patronage, it was decided that all newer transit authorities would be a conduit for federal funding, and operation would be provided by private companies, as it is to this day.\n\nUMass Transit Services operates PVTA's routes through the Five Colleges Area in eastern Hampshire County and neighboring towns, with most of the routes centered around UMass Amherst, the largest ridership generator in the service area. UMass Transit Services is a department within the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The UMass Transit garage is located on-campus at 255 Governors Drive, Amherst. All UMass Transit fixed-route buses are numbered in the 3000 series. UMass Transit is a student-based organization with more than 90% of the employee being students.\n\nM-47 was the only bus in the University fleet of 30 buses to be taken over by PVTA and was renumbered #3000. The Twin Coaches were sold, most to Walt Disney World and the remainder went into the charter fleet. Quickly a number of new RTS buses entered the PVTA-U Mass Fleet. #3000 became a hit, and two used buses of the same type arrived in Amherst. In its later service years, No. 3000 was primarily used on the system's Route 39 between the Smith College campus in Northampton and the Hampshire College campus in Amherst. As newer buses were purchased in the 1980s, #3000 was removed from PVTA line service, and it and the two used buses went into the University fleet. No. 3000 logged over a million service miles with UMass Transit.\n\nSeashore acquired No. 3000 at an unknown date, probably about 2010.", "additional_images": []}, "291": {"technical_information": {}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 3400", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Mockup of trolley car", "img_attribute": "Paul Kehoe in 1973", "img_src": "649-D1iIygquIt5yYQIBup5vInQ86LpdsXsfKRfFkGQ8lmpSxwtbacGiW5Mphgr3.jpg", "builder": "MBTA", "description": "1971 MBTA", "secondary_use": "None", "category": "Other", "year": "1971", "retired_from_service": "1972", "acquired_by_the_museum": "1972", "car_id": "291", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Mockup of trolley car", "img_src": "650-oFybHfWiG01ZjhVgxmCq2KveIVljlwZ4RfO14XlcxLykOERifFXSCW4hIJmy.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

The two-door buses cost $42, 642 each. The MTA \"New Look\" buses were equipped with an Environmental Kit exhaust. This included extra filters in the exhaust system and dual exhaust outlets near the roof line at the rear of the buses instead of at ground level in an attempt to reduce air pollution.

The company was renamed Western Flyer Coach in 1945. The Manitoba government acquired the company when it was failing financially in 1971 and renamed it Flyer Industries. Flyer Industries began building electric trolley buses in 1968 with its model E-700 after traditional builders of trackless trolleys had left the market. Flyer introduced its series 800, available in either diesel or electric coaches, in 1973. The province privatized the company in 1986 when it became New Flyer Industries.\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) ordered a fleet of 50 Flyer Industries model E-800 trackless trolleys (Nos. 4001 \u2013 4050) in 1975. The E-800s arrived in 1976 and replaced a fleet of aging 1951 Pullman trackless trolleys serving Cambridge, Watertown and Belmont from the Bennett Street and North Cambridge car houses. The MBTA's trolley coaches had unusual left-side doors for the station at Harvard Square. The E-800s served Boston's last trackless trolley routes, operating from Harvard Square to North Cambridge, Belmont, Watertown and Huron Avenue. The MBTA was also operating Silver Line trackless trolleys in the Seaport and under South Station. The North Cambridge coaches operated until replaced by a fleet of new Neoplan trackless trolleys. The first Neoplans entered service in 2004 and replaced all the Flyer Industries coaches by 2009. \n\nSeashore acquired MBTA Nos. 4013 and 4028 in 2007 when both operated for the museum's Transit Day event that year.

Based on a standard design from a Japanese manufacturer, the Standard Light Rail Vehicle was an attempt forced by the Federal Government to use a single car design for the three cities with vastly different needs. Eventually these differences led to Philadelphia dropping out of the project and subsequently acquiring shorter cars similar in configuration to the PCCs. With no new streetcars having been designed for the U. S. in over 20 years, technology had advanced tremendously, and the Standard LRV cars were an attempt to adopt the new technology to an old industry. Unfortunately, instead of having Tokyu Car Co. of Japan design the entire car, the Federal Government's Buy American policy required a high level of U. S. built content, so Boeing-Vertol (a subsidiary of the Boeing Company which built helicopters) was hired to procure and integrate the systems to be used. As a result, the components used were not always designed for railway service, resulting in a failure-prone car with little reliability. The original plug door mechanism contained over 2000 individual parts, compared to about 40 on a PCC. The air conditioning system drew intake air from below the car. Unfortunately it also vacuum cleaned the subway, drawing dust into the system and clogging the filters. The SLRVs' modern features included articulation, a pantograph, D.C. chopper propulsion, separately excited D.C. traction motors and air assisted hydraulic brakes. Sunburg-Ferrar styled the SLRVs to give a smooth, streamlined surface with continuous lines. These cars were the first in the U.S. to be termed \"light rail vehicles\" instead of streetcars. \n\nThe MBTA ordered 175 SLRVs in 1975, but deliveries were delayed and most, including No. 3424, did not enter service until 1977. Some of Boston's cars went to San Francisco as Boston rejected them. Boston wound up with about 142 cars instead of 175 in the original plans, and the entire fleet was never in service at once. One car was retired only days after it was accepted.\n \nBoston's SLRVs ran on the MBTA Green Line routes and carried the green paint scheme. Mechanical problems with the SLRVs meant that the MBTA had to keep operating some its PCC cars. The MBTA overhauled No. 3424 in 1981 and in 1986 giving it new doors and a roof air conditioner. In 1996, the MBTA contracted Amerail to rebuild about 70 cars, including No. 3424. The result of the rebuilds was that some of the car's most glaring faults were corrected. The rebuilds raised the cars' reliability to record levels, but parts supply became an issue as vendors were no longer willing to supply items unique to the cars. Newer Green Line vehicles from Kinki Sharyo and Breda allowed the MBTA to stop running its Boeing-Vertol cars by 2007. \n\nSeashore acquired No. 3424 as an example of the rebirth of the streetcar after its virtual demise in the 1950s. Seashore considered acquiring a different MBTA SLRV (No. 3444) which had its original plug doors. However, No. 3444 was not in operating condition. So, rebuilt car 3424 was chosen for preservation and moved to Maine by Silk Road Transportation, experts at moving very long rail cars. Since its arrival Seashore's members have addressed roof leaks and other issues threatening the car's electronics.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Green trolley 3424 historic photo", "img_src": "737-sThEWnrkHYbfnPcGv7FfXutNjudknOpE8XgkarRgsTpe8kkD3hnfSBLn6z7Y.jpg", "img_attribution": "Sister car 3418 in Boston from Bill Volkmer Collection at newdavesrailpix.com"}]}, "302": {"technical_information": {"motor": {"manufacturer": "Ford", "model": "V8"}}, "title": "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 1655", "source": "Boston, Massachusetts", "source_city": "Boston", "source_state": "Massachusetts", "img_alt": "Yellow Line Truck 1655", "img_attribute": "Kenyon F.

American Motors was the successor to the business started by Willys-Overland (producer of military jeeps) and later Kaiser Motors. AM General's primary product continued to be military trucks, but it also built a total of 5,431 buses and trolley buses. AM General based its buses on a design licensed from Western Flyer, of Winnipeg, Manitoba, for Western Flyer's model D700 bus. AM General's bus was available in 35-foot or 40-foot long models and was similar to the \"New Look\" buses produced by General Motors at the time. However, No. 322 was not used in a movie, but may have operated on a fan trip.\n\nThe Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District (SCMTD) was formed in 1968 to replace the privately-owned Santa Cruz Transit Company based in Santa Cruz, California. SCMTD provides transit service throughout Santa Cruz County. Initially, SCMTD subsidized operation by Santa Cruz Transit Co, but SCMTD took over operation in 1971. In 1977, to provide for route expansions, SCMTD ordered six AM General 35-foot length, model 9635B-6 buses. These buses, Nos. 846-851, were delayed at the factory for the installation of wheel chair lifts and did not arrive until February, 1978. These were the last motor buses that AM General built, although the firm subsequently produced trolley buses for Philadelphia and Seattle. Nos. 846-851 were the only AM General buses in the SCMTD fleet. \n\nAt some point before 1997, United Airlines acquired three AM General buses (Nos. 848-850) from SCMTD. No. 848 became United Airlines No. 322. United Airlines used these buses to shuttle crews at San Francisco. In 2003, Regional Transit in Riverside, CA acquired No. 322 and the other two AM General buses from United. Regional Transit is owned by Scott Richards and provides buses as props for movies and television productions.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority assigned color codes to each of its four rapid transit routes and selected blue for the line to Wonderland because of its closeness to water, running under Boston Harbor and near Massachusetts Bay. Passengers called these cars \"Bluebells\" because of their blue color and the chime of electric warning bells as doors closed. Blue Line cars needed to be shorter and narrower than typical rapid transit cars in order to fit through the East Boston tunnel that was originally designed for streetcars. These cars are also unusual due to their dual sources of power. The \"Bluebells\" drew electric power from a third rail while running underground and used pantographs to receive electric power from an overhead wire on surface portions of the line. The 1998 movie, Next Stop Wonderland, featured a romantic meeting aboard a train of \"Bluebells.\" During their years of service, the \"Bluebells\" suffered heavy corrosion damage from the salt air blowing in from the Atlantic Ocean. So, the MBTA gave cars #0622 and #0623 structural repairs, new sheathing and fresh paint to test the feasibility of rebuilding the entire fleet. After rebuilding these two cars, the MBTA determined the program was not cost effective and decided to replace the \"Bluebells\" with new equipment.\n\nAll Boston rapid transit cars have a \"0\" in front of their numbers to distinguish them from streetcars.\n\nThe four color-coded Boston rapid transit lines have varying design configurations. So, the Blue, Red, Orange and Green lines each have their own fleet of transit cars which are not interchangeable. The section of the Blue Line between downtown Boston and East Boston opened in 1904 as the East Boston tunnel. The Boston Elevated Railway operated this line with streetcars. Between East Boston and Revere, the Blue Line operates on the right-of-way of the former Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad which opened in 1875 as a narrow gauge steam railway. The BRB&L was electrified in 1928 and abandoned in 1940. The Boston Elevated purchased the right-of-way in 1941. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired the Boston Elevated in 1947, adopting the name Metropolitan Transit Authority and later Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The MTA began running over part of the BRB&L route as far as Orient Heights in 1952 and began operation of the full route from Boston to Wonderland station in Revere in 1954. The 1952 extension included a station serving Logan Airport. Blue Line trains switch between third rail and overhead wire power at the Airport station. The Blue Line terminal in Revere is named Wonderland after the nearby Wonderland Amusement Park (open between 1906 and 1911) and later the Wonderland Greyhound Park, which closed in 2009.", "additional_images": [{"img_alt": "Subway cars 0622-0623", "img_src": "602-0rn6ortnIbpdjF0wSitIeogIox9LXWVnQapv6HdICQVnJJGZoa3TfMpUIS6J.jpg", "img_attribution": "Kenyon F.

In 1987, General Motors sold the RTS design, and a series of other manufacturers continued producing RTS buses into the 2000s. \n\nThe first RTS production was an order of 400 buses by a consortium of six cities: Long Beach, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Oakland and Brockton. The first RTS buses went to Long Beach in 1977; Brockton's arrived in 1978 and 1979. Brockton Nos. 7701-7715 came in 1978 and Nos. 7801-7834 came in 1979. Nos. 7801-7834 were GMC's RTS model T7W-603 and had minor styling differences from the 7700s. The Brockton Area Transit Authority had been formed in 1973 to take over bus service in Brockton, MA from the Union Street Railway that was based in New Bedford, MA.\n\nIn the 1990s, Cape Ann Transportation Authority (CATA) acquired Nos. 7804, 7806, 7810, 7817 and 7833 from Brockton. At CATA, the buses retained their fleet numbers from Brockton. CATA had begun operation in 1974, replacing a series of private operators providing local bus service in Gloucester, MA and nearby towns. CATA retired its RTS buses in 2000. \n\nCATA donated Nos. 7804, 7806, 7810 and 7833 to Seashore in 2001. Seashore accessioned No. 7804. Seashore planned to use the others for parts or to sell to raise funds for preserved the remaining CATA buses.

General Motors of Canada Diesel Division built 53 of these buses. Ontario's articulated buses were 60 feet long and could bend in the middle, compared with standard buses which are up to 40 feet long. Prior to this project, articulated buses in the United States and Canada were unusual. Seashore also has an articulated bus from a small fleet in Omaha produced in 1947, and some U.S. cities imported articulated buses from Europe in the late 1970s. Most of the European articulated buses were \"pullers\" with the engine in the front section. The GM buses for Ontario were \"pushers\" with the engine in the rear, similar to most other non-articulated buses of the time. The rear engine required extra engineering because the majority of the weight was at the rear of the vehicle making it prone to jack-knifing. So, the articulated joint in the GM buses had anti-jack-knifing force and would lock up when the coach reached certain speeds to increase stability.\n\nOf the 53 articulated buses, six went to the Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) and were numbered 8201-8206. HSR is the city-owned operator of the transit system in Hamilton, Ontario. The corporate name dates to the horse car era in 1873 and has been retained long after HSR abandoned streetcars in 1951. After a three year trial, Toronto and Ottawa decided not to keep their articulated buses which were then distributed to Hamilton and Mississauga with Hamilton receiving nine from Ottawa. Hamilton's articulated buses originally had a yellow and black paint scheme inspired by the colors of the Hamilton Tigercats team in the Canadian Football League. In 2001, No. 8203 was renumbered to 518203. The bus also received a white paint scheme with yellow and blue stripes. The high capacity articulated buses commonly ran on the route linking McMaster University with downtown. In 2007, No. 518203 was the last of the 53 articulated buses to be retired. That year, HSR began operating new, hybrid diesel electric articulated buses. \n\nHamilton Street Railway donated No. 51823 to Seashore in 2009. A Seashore crew made repairs to the bus and, in a four-day trip, drove it to Kennebunkport. At Seashore, No. 518203 joined one other articulated bus: Omaha No. 1312. The Omaha bus, built in 1947, bends only vertically so that all wheels stay on the ground while climbing hills, unlike the Hamilton bus which bends horizontally.

These vehicles can also be termed \"trackless trolleys\" or \"trolley coaches.\" Trolley buses have some advantages as transit vehicles. They can accelerate and brake better than motor buses, and they have no exhaust and are almost silent. They are the best transit vehicles (aside from cable cars) for climbing and descending steep hills. A downside for trolley buses is their two overhead wires (thought by some to be unsightly) which are required to complete the electric circuit unlike streetcars which use rails for the return current. More importantly, until the 1990s, trolley buses were restricted to streets with the overhead wires. Since then, all newly manufactured trolley buses are equipped with auxiliary battery power which allows them to bypass streets undergoing construction and to extend service beyond the end point of the overhead wires. In the 1950s and 1960s, most North American transit operators replaced trolley bus routes with more versatile motor buses. \n\nThe last Edmonton streetcar ran in 1951. In common with other Canadian cities, Edmonton had a large trolley bus network which, at its peak, had 79 route miles. In 1981-82, the city-owned Edmonton Transit System replaced its older trolley buses with a fleet of 100 new trolley buses, Nos. 100-199. These vehicles consisted of bodies built by General Motors Diesel Division and electrical components by the Swiss firm, Brown Boveri & Company. Edmonton Nos. 100-199 were the only trolley buses built by General Motors, although Yellow Coach, which was a division of GM, built many trolley buses in the 1930s. GM's Edmonton trolley buses used the same \"New Look\" (unofficially, also termed \"Fishbowl\") body that GM used on over 44,000 motor buses. GM built \"New Look\" buses from 1959 to 1977 in the United States and until 1985 in Canada. The design featured a rounded windshield and a lightweight, aluminum skin. \n\nEdmonton Transit System put No. 125 in storage in 1998 and returned it to service in 2004. In June 2008, the city council voted to end its trolley bus operation, and, the next month, No. 125 was placed back in storage. The last trolley bus ran on May 2, 2009, leaving Vancouver as the only Canadian city still using trolley buses. Diesel buses then provided most of Edmonton's transit service. The city had also started a modern, light rail operation in 1978 which was expanded in 1983 and in more recent decades. More recently, the city has returned to electric-powered buses but without the overhead wires. Edmonton is now operating some hybrid buses as well as all-electric, battery-powered buses. \n\nEdmonton Transit System donated No. 125 to Seashore. It arrived at the museum in 2010.

The Orion was designed for easy maintenance and had a sleek, modern appearance. Ontario Bus Industries expanded to the United States market in 1981.

None of the other trucks could be brought back into service quickly with the resources available.\nAfter we secured funds for our hi-rail bucket truck, we went shopping. It turns out that hi-rail trucks are hard to find, and hi-rail bucket trucks even harder (young generations use the term to describe these items \"unicorn\"), and are often in very rough shape.\nWorking with a dealer in Tennessee, we eventually settled on an ex-Norfolk Southern signal department bucket truck. A generous member donated the purchase cost. We were able to arrange shipping to avoid COVID travel issues and the truck arrived in even better condition than we had hoped.\nWith two vehicles, one of which has long reach and both on- and off-rail capability, we should be able to attack overhead projects we could only think about before.
